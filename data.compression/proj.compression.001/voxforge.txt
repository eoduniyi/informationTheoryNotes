NOT OUT OF HIS THOUGHTS AND ANNE HAD EVERY THING TO DO AT ONCE AND ANNE IN THE JOY OF THE ESCAPE AND ANOTHER FOLD UNDERNEATH WHERE THE BUTTONS USED TO BE AND ANOTHER HOUR OF PLEASURE OR OF PENANCE AND ANY ONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO LEARN AND ANYONE WHO HAS STUDIED THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE KNOWS AND ANYWAY HE S PAST THE MOST TROUBLESOME AGE AND YOU WON T HAVE TO BE UP NIGHTS WITH HIM AND AND APPARATUS WAS DEVISED WHICH EXHIBITED THE EVOLUTION OF ALL THESE KINDS OF ACTION FROM ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY AND APPARENTLY MORE FULL OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN OF LITTLE CHARLES AND ARBITRARILY FIX THE PRICE OF PROVISIONS AND FURS AND ARE LIKELY TO HOLD FOR MANY MORE AND ARE SO FLEXIBLE THAT THEY ARE ADMIRABLY ADAPTED FOR WALKING AND ARRIVING AT FORT RELIANCE ON THE NINETEENTH MARCH AND AS A RESULT OF THIS IRRESPONSIBLE POWER THEY OFTEN REALISED A PROFIT AND AS ANNE FOLLOWED HER UP STAIRS AND AS EACH DESERTED THE SINKING SHIP I TOOK A GRIM DELIGHT IN MY MISERY AND AS FOR MRS SMITH AND AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK I STARTED TO WRITE AND THIS IS THE STORY AND AS HER OWN SISTER MUST BE BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND S SISTERS AND AS HIGH IN HIS PROFESSION AS MERIT AND ACTIVITY COULD PLACE HIM AND AS I BELIEVE IN EVERY OTHER SPHERE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY AND AS I VE NOTHING TO CHANGE EXCEPT MY SKIN AND AS IF HE FELT A LITTLE BIT FOOLISH AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED AND AS IT DID NOT FREEZE BUT REMAINED IN A LIQUID STATE AND AS LADY DALRYMPLE MUST BE WAITED FOR AND AS LONG AS SHE DARED OBSERVE HE DID NOT LOOK AGAIN AND AS LONG AS THIS FINE WEATHER LASTS AND AS NEATNESS IS THE FIRST

ALWAYS WIPING ITS MOUTH BEFORE DRINKING AND EACH BRANCH AND BRANCHLET ABOUT AS STRICTLY PINNATE AS THE MOST SYMMETRICAL FERN FROND AND EACH IS APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE PHYSICAL COSMOS BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND EACH ONE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE SLEDGE ASSIGNED TO HIM AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO AND EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM IT BY THE PURPLISH RED BARK WHICH IS ALSO MORE CLOSELY FURROWED THAN THAT OF THE WHITE AND EFFICIENT MODES OF PREVENTION DEDUCED FROM THE DATA SO OBTAINED AND EMBODIED IN THE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE KNOWN AS MECHANICS HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS AND EMPTY THEMSELVES INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN LAKES LAGOONS AND NUMEROUS POOLS AND ENABLED HIM TO RISE SUPERIOR TO ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND ENABLING HIM TO PASS OVER IT AND ENTERED INTO THE JOY OF RUNNING WATER AND WITH HIS EAR TO THE REED STEMS AND ESCAPED TO THE MONOS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RANGE AND ESPECIALLY WHENEVER MY HYPOS GET SUCH AN UPPER HAND OF ME AND ETIQUETTE IS FIRST AID ALWAYS TO FORMALITY AND EVEN A FEW INDIAN CHIEFS ABOUT A DOZEN AND EVEN AFRICA WITH ALL ITS TERRORS WAS TRAVERSED BY LIVINGSTONE AND EVEN CLINGING LIKE MOUNTAIN PINES TO RIFTS

EVERY MAN MAY THINK HIS OWN CAUSE JUST TILL IT BE HEARD AND JUDGED AND EVERY ONE STRONG MINDED OR VAIN ENOUGH CAN DIET AND EVERYBODY IN THE CITY WHO HAD NOTHING SPECIAL TO DO CAME IN AND LOOKED AT US AND EVERYBODY TOOK OFF ALL THE CLOTHES THEY HAD AND EVERYWHERE ANSWERING ALL INQUIRIES ABOUT THE FETE WITH THE WORDS AND EXCITED THE WARMEST CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER AND EXERTED IN THE SMALLER PARTICLES OF THE BODY THAT AND EXHAUSTIVE HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY GIVEN GENERALISATION FROM OBSERVATION MAY BE TRUE AND EXPERIMENTATION ON THE PHENOMENA WHICH ATTEND THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE AND AND EXTENDS FROM THE GRANITE HEADLANDS OVERLOOKING THE HOT PLAINS TO WITHIN A FEW MILES AND EXTENDS NEARLY TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE TIMBER LINE THENCE AND FALLETH NOT UNDER THE PRESENT QUESTION WHICH IS ONLY OF BODIES SUBORDINATE AND FANS FLOWERS AND SLIPPERS IN VARIOUS COLORS AND FAR MORE CONVENIENT FOR USE IT AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER AND FEEL AN HUNDRED

SAPLINGS GROWING HEARTILY ON MORAINES AND FOR EACH OF THESE MANY YOUNG TREES AND CROWDS OF EXUBERANT SAPLINGS SO THAT AND FOR FIVE HOURS THE CURLEW WAS ALLOWED TO DRIFT WHERE SHE LIKED AND FOR THAT REASON WE ALWAYS KEEP AWAY FROM DEEP MUDDY WATERS WHAT S MORE AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE BEEN DECREASING AND FOR THE LIMITS OF HOW FAR SUCH A BODY SHALL REPRESENT THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND FOR THE MOMENT SCIENCE IS THE DIANA OF ALL THE CRAFTSMEN AND FOR THE SAME REASON THEY DO NOT NECESSITATE THE USING UP OF ENERGY AND FOR THE SPRING GREEN EMERALD GREEN ASSUREDLY AND FORT ENTERPRISE AT NIGHT

BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND HABITS OF LONDON IN THE DEAD SEASON I EVEN DID RATIONAL THINGS AT THE INSTIGATION OF OTHERS AND HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO RETURN BY UNCLE JERRY AND HAD HER ANSWER READY AND HAD NEVER LIKED A CONCERT BETTER AT LEAST DURING THE FIRST ACT AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID AND HAD NEVER SEEN A WOMAN SINCE WHOM HE THOUGHT HER EQUAL AND HAD SETTLED INTO THE DISMAL BUT DIGNIFIED ROUTINE OF OFFICE CLUB AND CHAMBERS AND HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HEARING AND HAIMAIRES OF HULL AND HAS PROVED ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE OF INSTRUMENTS OF RESEARCH AND HASTILY FETCHED A FEW GLASSES OF THE PUNCH AND HAVE IT PERHAPS MADE OVER THE NEXT WOULD BETTER CHOOSE AND HAVE TAKEN AIM AT LEISURE AND HAVE THEIR ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY FOOD NOT FOR THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY TAKE SO LONG TO EAT AND HAVE THEREFORE NEED TO JOIN TOGETHER IN ONE SOCIETY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY EITHER PARTICIPATE OF THE GAIN AND HAVING AT THEIR DISPOSAL IMMENSELY IMPROVED APPLIANCES HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE BOUNDARIES OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING FOUND A HOME FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD AND HAVING NOT THE SMALLEST WISH FOR A TOTAL CHANGE AND HE AND JOLIFFE GAVE THE NEW ARRIVAL SUCH A RUBBING AND HE APPARENTLY TOOK NONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS AND HE ASKED HIS HAIRY UNCLE THE BABOON WHY MELONS TASTED JUST SO AND HE BAKED IT AND HE BAKED IT AND HE CAUGHT HIS TALL UNCLE THE GIRAFFE BY THE HIND LEG AND HE CERTAINLY DOES LOVE IT AND HE COUNTED THOSE THINGS AND HE DID AGREE ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND HE DID HURT MY ARM AND HE DID NOT DISGUISE FROM MRS BARNETT AND HE DID NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT AND HE DIDN T TELL HIM AND HE EXCHANGES THESE PIECES OF WOOD FOR MANUFACTURED ARTICLES ON THE PREMISES AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LYING ON THE TOP OF THE PROSTRATE RAT AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ROLLING IN THE WARM GRASS OF A GREAT MEADOW THIS IS FINE AND HE GAVE ME THIS TO KEEP IT LOOKS VERY UGLY AND HE HAD GROWN FROM A BOY TO A MAN AND HE HAD TIED IT FIRM WITH HIS SUSPENDERS AND HE HAD TO BRUSH AWAY A TEAR OR TWO WITH THE BACK OF HIS PAW AND HE HAS NEVER YET LEARNED HOW TO BEHAVE THE AND HE HAS NO MANNERS NOW AND HE NEVER WILL HAVE ANY MANNERS AND HE HASN T DONE A STROKE OF WORK SINCE MONDAY MORNING AND HE HEARD THE CRIES REDOUBLED AND COMBINED WITH VIOLENT BLOWS ON THE POSTERN GATE AND HE IS GOING TO PROVE IT TELL HIM THAT AND HE IS MORE NEARLY YOUR SIZE AND LOOKS MORE LIKE YOU AND HE IS STILL SMOKING CIGARETTES AND HE KNEW THAT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT TELL HIM WOULD BE TRUE AND HE LEAPED AND HE CREEPED AND HE PROWLED AND HE HOWLED AND HE HOPPED AND HE DROPPED AND AND HE LIVED IN AFRICA AND HE FILLED ALL AFRICA WITH HIS SATIABLE CURTIOSITIES AND HE LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOWLING DESERT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO WORK AND HE MADE FOR THE STEEP LITTLE TUNNEL WHICH ANSWERED IN HIS CASE TO THE GRAVELLED CARRIAGE DRIVE OWNED BY ANIMALS WHOSE RESIDENCES ARE AND HE MADE THE SEA FROTH UP WITH HIS TAIL AND HE MARRIED AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARD SO DID THE WHALE AND HE MATCHED THE SCLUSIVELY YELLOWISH GREYISH BROWNISH COLOUR OF THE HIGH VELDT AND HE NEEDS TO DO IT NOW AND HE NEVER HAD ANY MANNERS THEN SINCE OR HENCEFORWARD AND HE PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND HE PICKED UP HIS HAIRY UNCLE THE BABOON BY ONE HAIRY LEG AND HE PLAYED HOP SCOTCH WITH THE STARBOARD WATCH WHILE THE CAPTAIN TICKLED THE CREW AND HE PUT IT ON STOVE BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO COOK ON THE STOVE AND HE REFUSED TO PUT FORWARD ANY HYPOTHESIS AS TO THE PHYSICAL CAUSE AND HE RUBBED SOME MORE FOLDS OVER HIS LEGS AND HE SAID IT BETWEEN HIS TEETH LIKE THIS AND HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING IN MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE S WAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD AND HE SHALL HAVE SONS WHEN HE BECOMES A MAN AND HIS DESCENDANTS AND HE SHOUTED AT HIS BROAD AUNT AND HE SMILED ONE SMILE THAT RAN ALL ROUND HIS FACE TWO TIMES AND HE SPIKED THAT CAKE ON THE HORN OF HIS NOSE AND HE AND HE STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE AND HE STEPPED AND HE LEPPED AND HE DANCED HORNPIPES WHERE HE SHOULDN T AND HE STEPPED OUT ON THE SHINGLE AND WENT HOME TO HIS MOTHER AND HE STOPPED TO PALAVER AND POW POW WITH THE THREE AND HE SUFFERED THE ABSOLUTION TO BE PRONOUNCED OVER HIM AND HE SWAM A LITTLE BEHIND THE WHALE S RIGHT EAR AND HE THINKS IT IS JUST GETTING STARTED AND HE THOUGHT ME QUITE RIGHT YOUR SISTER BEING WITH YOU MY LOVE AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS AND HE THUMPED AND HE BUMPED AND HE PRANCED AND HE DANCED AND HE BANGED AND HE CLANGED AND HE HIT AND HE BIT AND HE WANTS HER TO PICK IT UP AND HE WAS A SMALL STUTE FISH AND HE WAS COMING THE VERY NEXT MORNING TO SHOOT WITH CHARLES AND HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE CROFTS TO DINE AT UPPERCROSS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK AND HE WAS EVEN ABLE TO GIVE SOME STRAIGHT BACK TALK TO A COUPLE OF MOORHENS WHO WERE SNIGGERING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HIS BEDRAGGLED APPEARANCE AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY LAUGHING THE MOLE COULD FEEL HIM LAUGHING AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR AND HE WAS GONE DIRECTLY JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT AND HE WAS HIMSELF AWARE OF THIS AND HE WAS TO REVICTUAL AT FORT ENTERPRISE AND HE WEPT CROCODILE TEARS TO SHOW IT WAS QUITE TRUE AND HE WILL ESTABLISH IT THAT IS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIEUTENANT HOBSON AND HE WILL INFALLIBLY LEAD YOU TO WATER AND HE WILL SAVE ME FROM THIS ENEMY FOR I SHALL FIGHT FOR THE LORD AND HIS PEOPLE AND HE S A HOWLER HIMSELF WITH A LONG NECK AND LONG LEGS AND HE S JUST SEVENTEEN MONTHS OLD LIKE DEAR LITTLE SARAH ELLEN IN THE GRAVEYARD AND WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE REFUSAL OF HIM BEFORE HE GOES TO THE POOR FARM AND HEARS NO MORE THOSE EVENING BELLS AND HEAT THAT SO MUCH WORK ALWAYS GIVES RISE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS TO SO MUCH HEAT AND HEAT THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LIKE AND HELPED TO COIL HIM UP ON THE ROCK AGAIN AND HER CHEEKS GLOWED BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST AND HER MOTHER NATURALLY REJOICES WITH HER AND IT IS PROPER THAT SHE SHOULD AND HER OWN SISTER MARY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED AND HER PASSION FOR TRAVELLING LED HER CONSTANTLY AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED AND HER SPIRITS IMPROVED AFTER TALKING HOWEVER OF THE WEATHER AND HER WRAPPED OR FITTED BODICE HAS CONTINUED TO LOOK THE SMARTEST IN EVERY BALLROOM AND HERE AND THERE A CANDLE LIKE A CANDLE MOVING ABOUT IN A TOMB AND HERE NOTHING BUT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT AVAIL US AND HERE SLEEPS HIS MEADOW AND THERE SLEEP HIS CATTLE AND HERE S ANOTHER IDEA AND HERE S ANOTHER IDEA PERIOD AND HERE S YOUR PIPE AND TOBACCO OH COME ALONG OUT OF IT AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER WAS INDEED ATTACHMENT AND HIS BLUE CANVAS BREECHES AND THE SUSPENDERS AND HIS BRIGHT ACTIVE CANADIAN WIFE A CERTAIN MAC NAB AND HIS WIFE AND HIS BROAD AUNT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS SPANKED HIM WITH HER BROAD BROAD HOOF AND HIS DISCOVERIES IN THIS BRANCH OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE WERE CONSIDERABLE AND HIS HABITS WERE SUCH AS PROMISE A LONG LIFE AND A ROBUST OLD AGE AND HIS HAIRY UNCLE THE BABOON SPANKED HIM WITH HIS HAIRY HAIRY PAW AND HIS LIPS PRESSED TOGETHER AS IF GLUED TO ONE ANOTHER AND HIS NOSE BEGAN TO STRETCH AND HIS NOSE KEPT ON STRETCHING AND HIS PRIDE BEGAN TO WHISPER THAT HE COULD DO IT EVERY BIT AS WELL AND HIS SHIELD BEARER WALKED BEFORE HIM HE CAME EVERY DAY AND CALLED OUT ACROSS THE LITTLE VALLEY AND HIS TALL AUNT THE OSTRICH SPANKED HIM AND HIS TALL UNCLE THE GIRAFFE SPANKED HIM WITH HIS AND HOLD THE HANDLE TIGHT HE MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HOLD HIS FORK EMIGRANT FASHION AND HOLDING IT IN MY LEFT HAND AND THE GUN IN MY RIGHT AND HOPE THERE WOULD BE NOW NO OCCASION FOR PUTTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OFF AND HOPED THE DOG FISH WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO FOLLOW US AND HOVE HIM INTO A HORNET S NEST AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF AND HOW FAR OFF THE EIGHTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND HOW GLAD AGAIN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED AND HOW HE FARED AND WHAT DANGERS AND HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED AND HOW PARTICULAR THEY WERE WHOM THEY SPOKE TO AND ABOUT ADVENTURES DOWN DRAINS AND HOW STERN WAS THE REPRIMAND OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES AND HOWEVER DENSE AND SOMBER THEY MAY APPEAR IN GENERAL VIEWS NEITHER ON THE ROCKY HEIGHTS AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE AND HUGE ICEBERGS WITH PRECIPITOUS SIDES AND HUNG IT IN THE GREAT GREY GREEN GREASY LIMPOPO TO COOL AND HYDRA WITH A HUNDRED HEADS WELL REPRESENT AND I ALLUDED TO A MATTER OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE COMPANY AND I AM A LOST MAN AND I AM DISPOSED TO TAKE REFUGE IN IGNORAMUS ET IGNORABIMUS AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT DAY A SCEPTICAL BIOLOGIST MIGHT EXERT AN EQUALLY BENEFICENT INFLUENCE AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT WITH THIS PHILISTINE AND I AM WELL AWARE HOW MANY TRAVELLERS HAVE FALLEN VICTIMS TO SAVAGES AND I CAN POTTER ABOUT DRY SHOD OVER MOST OF THE BED OF IT AND I CONFESS THAT I DO CONSIDER HIS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO HER WITH SOME SURPRISE AND I DO REGARD HER AS ONE WHO IS TOO MODEST FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO BE AWARE OF HALF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND I DON T DESERVE THIS AND I DON T WANT ANY OTHER WHAT IT HASN T GOT IS NOT WORTH HAVING AND I HAVE BUT TO STRETCH MY ARM OUT OF THIS SLEDGE AND I HOPE YOU VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT MIND BEING LEFT ALONE AN AND I MUST ADD THE WANT OF FORESIGHT OF THE HUNTERS AND I SHALL NOT BE DISPOSED TO GRUMBLE AT THE

SECOND OBJECT WAS TO BE SENSIBLE AND WELL JUDGING AND IF I CAN ADD TO YOUR STORE OF IT I WILL BE VERY GLAD AND IF IT BE A CRIME THE ASSEMBLY MAY BE PUNISHED AS FAR FORTH AS IT IS CAPABLE AND IF NECESSARY A KNIFE ALSO ALL RULES OF TABLE MANNERS ARE MADE TO AVOID UGLINESS AND IF ONE IS DINING AT HOME KEPT ON FOR DINNER AND IF SHE WANTED HIS HELP SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR IT AND IF SUCH PARTIES SUCCEED HOW SHOULD A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND IF THAT MUST BE THE END OF IT WHY SHOULD NOT LOVE UNBAR THE GATES TO HIM INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT AND IF THE GRADUAL PERFECTION OF MECHANICAL SKILL FOR INDUSTRIAL ENDS AND IF THE WIND SHOULD RISE EVER SO LITTLE AND IF THEY COULD BUT KEEP CAPTAIN WENTWORTH FROM BEING MADE A BARONET AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE AND IF THEY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE AND IF THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED AS NEWTON SUCCEEDED AND IF YOU ARE DRIVING IN A CLOSED MOTOR YOU CAN ALSO WEAR AN ORIGINAL TYPE OF DRESS AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT IN ENGLAND AND IF YOU MUST CUT DOWN CUT DOWN ON ELABORATE ONES AND IF YOU PAINT BRING YOUR GEAR I KNOW YOU SPEAK GERMAN LIKE A NATIVE AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE A LIVING EXAMPLE OF AND IF YOU RE IN TOWN AT ALL YOU RE PROBABLY JUST GETTING INTO HARNESS AGAIN AND CAN T GET AWAY AND IN A FEW MINUTES GAINED THE THEATRE OF THE STRUGGLE AND IN A MOMENT THE PUNCH WAS IN FLAMES AND IN AS MUCH AS THOSE AGED SEQUOIAS SO NEARLY CHILDLESS ARE AND IN CASE THE DESIGN OF THEM BE EVIL OR UNKNOWN TO THE COMMON WEALTH AND IN COMBINATION WITH PHOTOGRAPHY AND IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE COLONIAL SECRETARY AND IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY AND IN FORM IF NOT ALTOGETHER IN SUBSTANCE TO RETURN TO THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARISTOTLE AND IN ITS REDDER AND MORE CLOSELY FURROWED BARK GRAYISH GREEN FOLIAGE AND IN LEANING FORWARD A WOMAN S FIGURE MAKES A MORE GRACEFUL OUTLINE SUPPORTED ON HER ELBOWS AND IN LIKE FASHION ANOTHER VEHEMENT OPPONENT OF THE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES AND IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL CRUST OF THE EARTH AND IN MY OWN SMALL CASE HAD UPSET THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MYSELF AND K AND IN NO HANDS DID IT PROVE MORE BRILLIANTLY PROFITABLE AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A POSITION OF IMPORTANCE PERSONALITY IS ALSO ESSENTIAL AND IN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY AT ANY RATE AND IN SHORT HE HAD LOOKED AND SAID EVERYTHING WITH SUCH EXQUISITE GRACE AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF THE ROOM AND IN THE EARTH BELOW AND AROUND HIM PENETRATING EVEN HIS DARK AND LOWLY LITTLE AND IN THE END MADE MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF APPEAL HAD SPOKEN AS HE FELT AND IN THE FOUR CORNERS WERE TRIANGULAR BLOCKS OF SWEET PHLOX OVER WHICH THE BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERED UNCEASINGLY AND IN THE INVENTION OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF DEALING AND IN THE LAST CASE THAT OF ISOMERIC COMPOUNDS THE APPEAL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DITCH A SILVER FIR IS GROWING AND IN THE SECOND IS A TEMPTATION TO A THIEF AND IN THE SNOW THINK OF ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS WHO PUT ON AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS AND IN THE TWENTY YEARS DURING WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF TO ASTRONOMY AND IN THIS RESPECT AND IN THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AND IN TRYING TO TEAR ASUNDER THE EXISTING BONDS OF UNITY ARE AND IN USQUEBAUGH WHILE CHARLES FLIRTED WITH HIS THREE SULTANAS AND INCIDENTALLY SUCH DISCIPLINE AND CHASTENING AS MIGHT ULTIMATELY PRODUCE MORAL EXCELLENCE AND INCLINED TO DROOP IN HANDSOME CURVES CONTRASTING WITH THE STIFF DARK COLORED TRUNK AND INCLUDING THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE AND INDEED MARY I CANNOT WONDER AT YOUR HUSBAND AND INDISTINCTNESS WHAT MIGHT NOT EIGHT YEARS DO EVENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION AND INFLUENCES ME IN SOME UNACCOUNTABLE WAY HE CAN BETTER ANSWER AND INGENERABLE IN NATURE THE PHENOMENAL WORLD AND INTO THE DEEP HOLE THE LOWER WATERS OF WHICH ARE MUDDY AND INVADED ONE ANOTHER WITH PRIVATE FORCE YET IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE DONE UNJUSTLY AND IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CHESTERFIELD INLET AND IS GREATLY PRIZED AS A LUMBER TREE BUT IN THE SIERRA IT IS SCATTERED AMONG OTHER TREES AND IS GROWING UPON THE TERMINAL MORAINE OF THE RESIDUAL GLACIER THAT OCCUPIED THE SOUTH FORK CANON AND IS OBLIGED BY THE LATER AND BECOMES BOTH BORROWER AND LENDER AND IS ONLY TO BE FOUND NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC AND IS OUT OF PLACE THIRTY DEGREES FROM THE NORTH POLE AND IS SHED OFF IN MYRIADS OF MINUTE SPARKLES THAT SEEM TO COME FROM THE VERY HEART OF THE TREES AND IS SITUATED EXACTLY AT SIXTY ONE DEGREES TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE AND IS SUPPORTED AT THE SIDE BY HIS THUMB HIS OTHER FINGERS CLOSE UNDERNEATH AND IS THE HANDSOMEST TYPE OF EVENING DRESS THAT THERE IS AND IS THIS OK WITH YOU AND IT COMPLETELY FILLS A VAST NATURAL HOLLOW AND IT ENDED IN HIS MAKING A BOLD PUBLIC DECLARATION AND IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS EQUALLY SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR AND IT HAD BEEN A LUCKY THING FOR PETER THAT THAT HOLE AND IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO OTHER DISEASES WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS AND IT HURT HIM HIJJUS AND IT IS A CURIOUS EXAMPLE OF THE INTERCONNECTION OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND IT IS A FINE FAMILY IF I DO SAY SO AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ONESELF HEARD ABOVE THE MUSIC BY ONE S TABLE COMPANIONS AND IT IS MUCH EASIER TO SUPPLY HIM WITH A CLEAN BIB FOR THE NEXT MEAL AND IT IS NOW A DOUBTFUL POINT WHETHER HIS CUNNING OR HERS MAY FINALLY CARRY THE DAY AND IT IS ONLY AMONG THE MOST FASHIONABLE AND IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE PRESENT EPOCH THAT ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND IT IS PROBABLE HE WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO FURTHER DETAILS AND IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND UNTIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND IT OFTEN APPEARED WHEN THE WEATHER HAD CLEARED THAT HE D BEEN IN HIS BUNK BELOW AND IT ONLY HARASSES ME YOU WHO HAVE NOT A MOTHER S FEELINGS AND IT OUGHT TO BE GIRAFFE AND IT OUGHT TO BE ZEBRA AND IT RESTS WITH ME TO SAY WHAT KERNEL LIES WITHIN ITS SHELL AND IT SMELT LIKE ZEBRA AND IT FELT LIKE ZEBRA AND IT SPOILED HIS TEMPER AND IT SUPPORTS LIFE AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE AND IT TAKES QUITE SUPER HUMAN CONTROL FOR A YOUNG MOTHER NOT TO SHOW OFF HER TREASURE AND IT WAS A GROUP IN WHICH ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALSO NECESSARILY INCLUDED AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE CONDITIONS THUS FAR AFFECTING THEM HAVE ENABLED THE YOUNG SEQUOIAS TO GAIN A MARKED ADVANTAGE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THREE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THEY AGAIN SET AND IT WAS ONLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT REDI AND IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE HUNTERS TO CATER FOR THEM AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE AND IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE SURPRISING THAT THE GREENWICH ASTRONOMER AND IT WOULD BE HIGHLY ABSURD IN HIM WHO COULD BE OF NO USE AT HOME TO SHUT HIMSELF UP AND IT WOULDN T TO YOU IF YOUR MIND WAS ON YOUR DUTY AND ITS ANCIENT RICHNESS IN SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS COMPARING OUR SIERRA GIANT AND SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS AND ITS AUTHOR HAD NO ADEQUATE ACQUAINTANCE AND ITS BEAUTY IS OF A KIND MORE EASILY APPRECIATED BUT THEN IT IS ON THE OTHER HAND AND ITS CHIEF USE IS NOT FOR WEAR AT THE TEA TABLE SO MUCH AS FOR DINNER ALONE WITH ONE S FAMILY AND ITS RAYS REFLECTED ON THE SNOW GAVE MORE LIGHT THAN HEAT AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON AND JOIN ME IN A LITTLE YACHTING AND I HOPE DUCK SHOOTING AND JUMPS ON A HORSE IN WHATEVER SHE HAPPENS TO HAVE ON AND JUST AS HE SAID FITCH THE MARINER WALKED OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND JUST THEN A WAGER BOAT FLASHED INTO VIEW THE ROWER A SHORT STOUT FIGURE AND KEEPS HER WORD AND KEEPS UP HER OLD HABIT OF HAVING THE LAST WORD AND KEPLER AND GALILEO AND MY WORTHY PHYSICIAN HARVEY DID IN MY DAY AND KINDLY URGED HER TO LET HIM COME AND FETCH HER AND KING GEORGE COULD SEND A MESSAGE FROM LONDON TO YORK AND KING S RIVER BASINS WHICH POURED ITS FROZEN FLOODS TO THE PLAIN AND KING S RIVERS BY THE LOFTY PROTECTIVE SPURS OUTSPREAD EMBRACINGLY ABOVE THE WARM SEQUOIA FILLED BASINS AND KNIFE THE PROPER USE OF THE FORK AS SOON THEREFORE AS HIS HAND IS DEXTEROUS ENOUGH AND LACK OF GOOD SENSE FAIR PLAY NOTHING APPEALS TO CHILDREN MORE THAN JUSTICE AND LADY RUSSELL HAD BEEN LESS GIFTED IN THIS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET S DIAGNOSIS AND LASTLY TO THE UPPER PINE BELT WHICH SWEEPS UP THE ROCKY ACCLIVITIES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM IT WAS SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE YOSEMITE FALL AND LAUGHED AT THEM THEN HE SAID HUMPH AND WENT AWAY AGAIN AND LAWFUL EMPLOYMENT HE HAS FOR THEM REQUIRES IT IS FACTION AND UNLAWFUL AND LEANED BACK BLISSFULLY INTO THE SOFT CUSHIONS WHAT A DAY I M HAVING HE SAID AND LEANING OVER SADLY IT STOOD ON A SHARP BLEAK CORNER AND LEAVING THEM WITH A LAUGH TO FLING ITSELF ON FRESH PLAYMATES THAT SHOOK THEMSELVES FREE AND LEFT A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR FELLOW CREATURES AND LEFT THE COSMICAL PART OF THE DOCTRINE TO OTHERS AND LET US HOPE THE SENSE WILL BE LASTING AND LIE IN EASY INDEPENDENCE CRACKING NUTS AND LAUGHING AND CHATTERING AS HEEDLESS OF THE FUTURE AND LOCATED FARTHER UP THE VALLEY WAS BURNED TO PROVIDE FOR THE OVERFLOW OF VISITORS AND LOOK ABROAD OVER THE TENTS OF THE HOSTILE ARMY AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEN SHE COULD GIVE ANOTHER GLANCE HE HAD MOVED AWAY AND LOOKED GRAVE AND SPOKE LOW WORDS BOTH TO THE FATHER AND THE AUNT AND LOOKED LIKE A WATERPROOF HE SAID NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT AND LOOKING FOR THEIR BREAKFASTS EVERY ONE OF THEM AS FRESH AS A LILY AND AS CHARMINGLY ARRAYED AND LOOKING ON THE BROAD BACK OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE BEFORE HER AND LOOKING UP SAW A SWINGING SIGN OVER THE DOOR WITH A WHITE PAINTING UPON IT AND LOST NO TIME IN EXAMINING THEM AND ENDEAVORING TO COLLECT SPECIMENS AND SEEDS AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE AND MADE FREE TO THE PUBLIC THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND MADE HIMSELF ONE CAKE WHICH WAS TWO FEET ACROSS AND AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE AND IN HIS CALIFORNIA MAGAZINE AND MADE THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE RETREAT HURRYING BACK TO THE CAMP WHICH I REACHED BEFORE DUSK AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AND MADE TO LOOK TRIM CORRECT RIDING CLOTHES ARE NOT AND MADGE TREATED PAULINA AS HER DAUGHTER AND MAINTAINING ITS YOUTHFUL FRESHNESS UNDIMINISHED FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY THROUGH A THOUSAND STORMS AND MAKE ANOTHER DRESS WITH A JET HARNESS AND MAKE ENQUIRIES IN RETURN AND MAKE THE MOST OF WHATEVER MOISTURE FALLS AGAIN AND MAKES HER FACE UP ALSO THE BACKS OF HER HANDS AND MAKING YET A LITTLE ADVANCE SHE INSTANTLY SPOKE AND MANY A FAIR FLOWER AND SHRUB WOULD HAVE FOUND FOOD AND A DWELLING PLACE IN WEATHERED NOOKS AND CREVICES AND MANY A STROLL AND MANY A SIGH WERE NECESSARY AND MANY A TIME I HAVE WATCHED HIM SWIMMING ABOUT BY THE HOUR AND MANY OF THESE ROUGH BOULDER SLOPES ARE OCCUPIED BY IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AND MANY OTHER PLANTS WHICH WILL KEEP HIS MEMORY SWEET AND FRESH AND MANY PEOPLE ASSUME THAT WE ALREADY HAVE DONE MANY AND MARBRE AND SABINE TAKING IMMEDIATE POSSESSION AND MASSES OF GRANITE OR HALF THAWED ICEBERGS AND MAY BUY AND SELL EXPORT AND IMPORT THEIR MERCHANDISE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN DISCRETIONS AND MEN OF GREAT NATURAL GIFTS HAVE FAILED ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY AND MERCILESSLY ORDERED MEN INTO CONFINEMENT FOR THE SLIGHTEST NEGLECT AND METHODICALLY KNOCKING PEOPLE S HATS OFF THEN I ACCOUNT IT HIGH TIME TO GET TO SEA AS SOON AS I CAN AND MORE THAN ALL IF JUST PREVIOUS TO PUTTING YOUR HAND INTO THE TAR POT AND MORE THAN HALF EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AND MOST OF ALL AT THIS SEASON SO I DROPPED OUT OF THE FRESH AIR BRIGADE AND MOTHER S RIGHTS IT WOULD BE PREVENTED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE AND MOUNT THE BRONZE BALUSTRADED STAIRS HALF WAY WHEN AND MR ELLIOT HAD MANOEUVRED SO WELL AND MR ELLIOT WAS INVITED BY ELIZABETH AND MISS CARTERET AND MR MUSGROVE HAD CALLED ON HIM AND MR MUSGROVE NO LONGER UNDER THE FIRST UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS HEIR AND MRS BARNETT AND MADGE ALSO EXCHANGED A FEW SENTENCES AND MRS OLDNAME IS JUST SUCH A PERSON AND MRS PAULINA BARNETT EXPRESSED HER SURPRISE AND MRS ROBINSON IS TOO NEAT PEOPLE DON T SEEM TO LIKE ANY BUT THEIR OWN BABIES OBSERVED EMMA JANE AND MUMMY TELLS YOU TO LET HER SLEEP AND MUST NOW BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE AND MY ADVICE TO YOU ETHIOPIAN AND MY ADVICE TO YOU LEOPARD IS TO GO INTO OTHER SPOTS AND MY HEART SANK ONCE MORE AS I SAW THAT HE NOW INTENDED TO THROW US IN THE GUTTER OF THE ROADWAY AND MYSELF AND NATIVE HUNTERS SELDOM GO FURTHER NORTH THAN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME AND NEVER MAKING WHAT WOULD BE CALLED A FOREST IT IS NOT PARTICULAR IN ITS CHOICE OF SOIL AND NEVER SWEPT OUT HIS CAMP HE TOOK THAT AND NEVER WEAR A DAY DRESS WITHOUT ONE AND NEXT HE WAS KIND TO HIS POOR PULLED NOSE AND NIGHT FISHINGS WITH OTTER OR EXCURSIONS FAR A FIELD WITH BADGER AND NIPPED BY THE TERRIBLE COLD AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE AND NO ONE OF PROPER CONDITION HAS SINCE PRESENTED HIMSELF AND NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND NOT A NECESSARY RESULT OF THE NATURE OF LIVING MATTER GEOLOGY IS AS IT WERE AND NOT BEING ENFORCED DID NEVERTHELESS THROUGH HIS OWN FOLLY LEND HIS MONEY AND NOT BY ASSEMBLIES AS THEY GOVERNED THE CITY OF ROME AND TERRITORIES ADJACENT AND NOT DEFICIENT IN UNDERSTANDING BUT BENWICK IS SOMETHING MORE AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN OH SIX AND NOT INSIST ON PLAYING THE GAME SHE LIKES INSTEAD OF THOSE WHICH THE OTHER CHILDREN SUGGEST AND NOT MUCH LESS IN THICKNESS RICH CHOCOLATE BROWN IN COLOR AND PROTECTED BY STRONG DOWN CURVING HOOKS AND NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO MOLE BUT THE MOLE WAS VERY FULL OF LUNCH AND SELF SATISFACTION AND NOT TO TAKE TOO MUCH CREDIT TO THEMSELVES AND NOT TRY TO GRAB MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF FAVORS OR TOYS AND NOT WANT THE BEST TOYS IN THE GRAB BAG OR SCREAM BECAUSE ANOTHER CHILD GETS THE PRIZE THAT IS OFFERED IN A CONTEST AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE INCORRECT THAN THE ASSUMPTION ONE SOMETIMES MEETS WITH AND NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO TAKE THE EUCHARIST AND NOTHING ELSE YOU ENTER THE LOWER RECEPTION HALL AND NOTHING LOOKS SMARTER THAN THEY WHEN WELL MADE AND WELL AND NOTWITHSTANDING SPORADIC ATTEMPTS TO RECALL MEN TO THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE AND NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE EVER TOSSING OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM MOST EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES AND NOW AT TWELVE SHE AMUSED HERSELF WITH PHRASES AND SENTENCES AND IMAGES AS HER SCHOOLMATES PLAYED WITH THE PIECES OF THEIR DISSECTED PUZZLES AND NOW BEHOLD THE AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS AND NOW CAME THE MOST CRUEL TRIAL FOR THE HIDEOUS TRUTH DAWNED ON ME AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM AND NOW HE DOESN T TRUST HER ANYMORE AND NOW I DIE AND NOW I AM BUT MADE THE GLASS IS FULL AND NOW I LIVE AND NOW MY LIFE IS DONE I SOUGHT MY DEATH AND FOUND IT IN MY WOMB AND NOW I LIVE AND NOW MY LIFE IS DONE THE SPRING IS PAST AND NOW I THINK I LL GO HOME TO ALL MY DEAR FAMILIES AND NOW IF MADAME WILL PERMIT ME TO SUGGEST AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT AND NOW RETURN TO THE FIRST FRAME AND NOW THE GATES OF WHITEHALL AND NOW THE GLASS IS RUN AND NOW I LIVE AND NOW MY LIFE IS DONE AND NOW WHO WAS THIS ASTRONOMER WHERE DID HE COME FROM AND OBLIVION OF THE PAST HOW NATURAL HOW CERTAIN TOO AND OCCASIONALLY THE RATTLING NOISE DROWNED EVERY OTHER SOUND AND OCTOBER FOGS EVERY SANE YACHTSMAN WAS PAYING OFF HIS CREW NOW THERE OUGHT TO BE DUCK AND OCTOBER THEN THE FLAT SCALES OPEN AND THE SEEDS TAKE WING AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR AND OF ARISTOCRATICALS AND DEMOCRATICALS OF OLD TIME IN GREECE ARE UNJUST AND OF BUFFON IN HIS THEORIE DE LA TERRE AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS ARE DESTROYED AND OF DEDUCTIONS FROM TIDAL PHENOMENA TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE DAY AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE AND OF IMPROVED MEANS OF PRODUCING ORDINARY ELECTRICITY AND OF INDUSTRY ARE IDENTICAL THAT SCIENCE CANNOT MAKE A STEP FORWARD AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY BOYLE HAD PRODUCED MODELS OF EXPERIMENTATION AND OF THE LIVING POPULATION OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN AND OF THE PALAETIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND OF THE RELATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS OF MATTER TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY AND OF THE SPLENDID CONSTELLATIONS OF THE POLAR SKIES AND OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OF THE MOON IN PAST EPOCHS AND OF THOSE THAT DO PERHAPS NOT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND IS SUFFERED TO LIVE AND OF WHICH THE INDIANS TALKED LONG AFTERWARDS IN THEIR WIGWAMS AND OF WHICH THE WIGHT DEATH IS THE ONLY GLAZIER AND OFF THEY RAN QUITE AS FULL OF GLEE AS OF LOVE AND OFTEN AFFORD CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF IT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT CERTAIN FORMS PERSIST WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGE AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH S MAKING A DISTANT BOW AND ON IT AND IN IT SAID THE RAT IT S BROTHER AND SISTER TO ME AND ON THE COASTS OF GREENLAND AND SPITZBERGEN AND ON THE FEW OCCASIONS I HAD MET HIM SINCE I MADE MY TRIUMPHANT DEBUT IN SOCIETY AND ON THE FIRST MAY THE EXPEDITION ARRIVED AT FORT ENTERPRISE AND ON THE MORROW THE DIFFERENCE WAS SO GREAT AND ON THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE ASSEMBLED IF THE OCCASION BE LAWFUL AND MANIFEST AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT EVERY ADVANCE OF INDUSTRY AND ON THE TOP FLOATED SLICES OF LEMON SHRIVELLED WITH AGE AND ON THE WHOLE REBECCA S FIGURE OF SPEECH WAS NOT SO WIDE OF THE MARK AND ON THIS THEORY AND ONE DAY HE TOOK FLOUR AND WATER AND CURRANTS AND PLUMS AND SUGAR AND THINGS AND ONE DAY THE LIEUTENANT SAID TO HIM AND ONE ENERGY IMPLIES THAT THE RULES OF ACTION OF THAT ENERGY AND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DEGREES WEST LONGITUDE AND ONE OF THE LARGEST AND LONGEST LIVED OF THE GIANTS THAT FLOURISH THROUGHOUT THE MAIN PINE BELT AND ONE OF THEM WELL DESERVED TO TAKE FIRST RANK AMONGST CELEBRATED FEMALE TRAVELLERS AND ONE TO ME ARE AND ONE UPPER STOREY IN IT LIVED THE COMMANDANT AND HIS OFFICERS AND ONLY BE SORRY TO THINK THAT THE COTTAGE PARTY PROBABLY AND ONLY BY VERY SLOW DEGREES CAME AT LAST NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO HER AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON AND OTHER ACID MOLECULES WITHOUT ALTERING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE SALT JUST AS A CUBE OF BRICKS AND OTHER FACTORIES SO THAT MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND OTHER SEVERAL PARTS OF THEIR TERRITORY TO SEND TO HIM THEIR DEPUTIES AND OTHER SUCH MALADIES HAS GIVEN A NEW DIRECTION TO PROPHYLACTIC AND CURATIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE WORST SCOURGES OF HUMANITY AND OUR FINGERS ON THE TRIGGERS INDEED YES MADAM AND OWN BROTHER OF JOVE SURELY ALL THIS IS NOT WITHOUT MEANING AND PALE BLUE OR YELLOW TO THOSE WITH FAIR SKIN AND PARALYSES THEIR ENERGIES WITH THE BITTER COLD AND PARTLY UPON THE EXERTION OF THE THROWER SO THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE REMAINING THE SAME AND PASS AND TURN AGAIN AND PASS SANDWICHES AND CAKES IF THERE ARE NO BOYS GIRLS PERFORM THIS OFFICE AND PASSED THE SIGN OF THE CROSSED HARPOONS AND PATIENCE FOR THE WEARISOME AND PERENNIAL STREAMS AND I CONFESS THAT AT FIRST I SHARED IN THE BLUNDER AND PERHAPS EMMA JANE CAN BRAID IT AS YOU GO ALONG THE ROAD AND PERHAPS THE SACRIFICE OF A GOOD MANY LIVES AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES AND PINE IN VAIN THE SACRED SEVEN AND PLANTED THE MOLE IN AN ARM CHAIR IN FRONT OF IT AND PLEASE CAN REBECCA GO TOO AS IT S SATURDAY MORNING AND VACATION BESIDES AND PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A HALF A DOZEN DRESSES AND THEIR ACCESSORIES AND PLUCKED A LARGE BUNDLE OF GRASS AND PLUNGING INTO THE SNOW ALREADY A FOOT DEEP AND POURED OUT HER WHOLE HEART TO HIM AND PRECISION FOR THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA AND PRECISION G AT PRESENT MORE ORGANIC ANALYSES ARE MADE IN A SINGLE DAY THAN WERE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE LIEBIG S TIME IN A WHOLE YEAR AND PREPARATIONS FOR BONFIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS AND PRESENTLY WITH RENEWED SPIRIT WITH A LITTLE SMILE AND PRESSED ON FROM FORT TO FORT IN A SLEDGE AND PRESSED THEM ALL OVER THE LEOPARD AND WHEREVER THE FIVE FINGERS TOUCHED AND PRESSURE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRETEND WE LIKED IT HE WAS GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN A HOUSE BOAT AND PREVENT A RELAPSE INTO BARBARISM IT WAS IN SOME SUCH SPIRIT AND PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT AND PRIDE AND ALREADY QUITE AT HOME IN A BOAT SO HE THOUGHT AND PRIOR TO THE DAYS WHEN THE ORANGEMEN HAD SENT FORTH THEIR DEFIANT PEAL AND PROBABLY THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE POLE AND PROCESSES EASILY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY OF RECOLLECTION BUT BY ITS VERY FORM AND PROCLAIMS THE SURPASSING GRANDEUR OF THE SPECIES YELLOW OR SILVER PINE PINUS PONDEROSA AND PROGRESSIVE AND OCCUPIED AND INSTEAD OF HAVING AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE PRICKING HIM AND WHISPERING AND PROMONTORIES OF THE LARGER EQUINOX WHICH ABUTS ON THE ISLANDS OF MAZANDERAN AND PROVING THAT THE TWO HUNTERS WERE RIOT MISTAKEN AND PURSUED THEIR JOURNEY TO THE NORTH AND PUSHES OUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE INTO THE HOT VOLCANIC PLAINS AND PUT IT ON AND THE RHINOCEROS DID AND PUT THE STOVE ON ITS LEGS AND QUITE AS LITTLE DO I DESIRE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT AND QUIVERING WITH EVERY MOTION OF THEIR THICK BLACK HAIR AND RAN DOWN ITS IMPULSIVE STACCATO SENTENCES AFFECTING TO IGNORE WHAT A GUST OF FRESH AIR AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE AND RAPIDLY ROSE TO THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT AND REACHES THE CLIMATE MOST CONGENIAL TO IT AT ABOUT FROM THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND FEET AND REACHING THE SIERRA FOOT HILLS YOU ENTER THE LOWER FRINGE OF THE FOREST AND REBOUNDING TWISTED ITSELF ROUND CORPORAL JOLIFFE S OWN NECK AND RECEIVE ME AS A HOSTAGE AND RECITED THE FOLLOWING SLOKA WHICH AND RECOLLECT THE COST OF THE FIRST LUCIFER MATCHES AND RED PROMINENCES OF THE MOON HE LIVED BUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND REINED IN ITS FOAMING MOUTH AND REJOICE OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT AND REMOVED ONE AT A TIME BETWEEN FINGER AND THUMB AND REQUIRES A STRONG DECOCTION OF SENECA AND THE STOICS TO ENABLE YOU TO GRIN AND BEAR IT AND REVEALED A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL PERIOD AND ROAST BEEF WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR OATS AND ROLLED AND ROLLED AND ROLLED AND EVERY TIME HE ROLLED AND SAID A FEW KIND WORDS TO THEM AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER AND SAID TO ALL HIS DEAR FAMILIES GOODBYE AND SALVATION AND SAW HIS OWN IMAGE IN THE WATER AND SAW THAT FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE GROWING THINGS OF THE WOODS AND PRAIRIES WERE HIS ONLY OBJECTS OF PURSUIT AND SAW THAT THE DOG FISH WERE GAINING ON US SO WE TURNED INTO A HARBOR AND SAW THAT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE GOT HIGHLY EXCITED AND SCLUSIVELY TUFTS OF SANDY YELLOWISH GRASS THE GIRAFFE AND SECONDARILY A SELECTMAN AND AN OVERSEER OF THE POOR A MAN THEREFORE POSSESSED OF WIDE AND VARIED INFORMATION AND SECTIONS ON A TRUE SCALE ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND SEE THE WATERY PART OF THE WORLD AND SEE WHAT SORT OF A PLACE THIS SPOUTER MAY BE AND SEEING HER THROUGH ALL THE PETTY DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE AND SEEKING THAT SECRET OF THE CAUSE OF FORMS AND SEEKS THE EXPLANATION OF THIS IMPORTANT TRUTH FROM THE SISTER SCIENCES AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST AND SEEMED TO BE INSEPARABLY GLUED TOGETHER AND SEEMINGLY BOUND FOR A DIVE STRANGE AND SELL ABROAD AT HIGHER RATES AND ABROAD THERE IS BUT ONE BUYER OF FOREIGN MERCHANDISE AND SET HIM DOWN ON THE BANK A SQUASHY PULPY LUMP OF MISERY AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF BUT IN THIS CASE AND SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF HIS SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH BOOKS AND SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THE REVENUE AND SHAKING OFF HIS TATTERS WITH HIS SHIVERINGS AND SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS AND SHE CANNOT SAY NO AND SHE COULD NOT THINK DIFFERENTLY LET HIM THINK OF HER AS HE WOULD AND SHE DID NOT MEAN WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL ON LADY RUSSELL S ACCOUNT AND SHE FELT THAT HIS ENTHUSIASM WAS A GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD SHRINK FROM NO OBSTACLE AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE DEMANDS OF THE PARTY AND SHE HAD SACRIFICED FOR THE YOUNG MAN S SAKE AND SHE HAS DONE IT BEFORE AND SHE MIGHT FLATTER HERSELF WITH HAVING BEEN GREATLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE CONNEXION AND SHE MUCH PREFERS WEARING RINGS TO GLOVES AND SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROOM WITHOUT HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM AND SHE SOON BECAME VERY EXPERT IN SLIDING OVER THE SNOW AND SHE TOLD HIM NOT TO COME AROUND FOR A WHILE AND SHE WAS ALL BUT CALLING THERE IN THE SAME HALF HOUR AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SEEM TO RESTORE HER ATTENTION TO THE ORCHESTRA AND SHE WAS JUST IN TIME BY A SIDE GLANCE AND SHIRT WAISTS OF ORANGE LINEN OR CREPE DE CHINE AND SHORT AND EASY PARTS IN GENTEEL COMEDIES AND AND SHOULD HE BE ABLE SATISFACTORILY TO ESTABLISH THEIR ORIGIN AND SHOULD NEITHER BE PERMITTED TO CHILDREN NOR PRACTISED IN THEIR PRESENCE AND SILVER FIR WOODS WILD WITH DELIGHT A FEW YEARS LATER AND SINCE ALL THE TREES THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO THEM HAVE BEEN PRESERVED AND SINCE THE MORAINES HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED UPON THE SOLID ROCK AND ONLY UPON ELECTED PLACES AND SLAPPED IT ON HIS HEAD AND SMILED AS SHE OPENED HER EYES THE RENOVATION OF CREATION IN SPRING AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS ONE NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET AND SO CONCLUDED TO DIVIDE UP HIS KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM AND SO DOES A SHORT SKIRT THAT HAS A STRAIGHT HEM AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO AND SO FAR IS EITHER FROM BEING THE OUTCOME OF PURELY INDUCTIVE REASONING AND SO HE CALLED UPON THE ANGLO NORMANS UNDER STRONGBOW AND SO I SHALL GO WITH YOU AND SO LITTLE WAS SAID AT LAST THAT SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM TO GO EVERY MOMENT AND SO MANY WERE PUT TO DEATH AND SO MUCH HEAT TO SO MUCH MECHANICAL WORK THUS ORIGINATED THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT AND SO OPEN A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PACIFIC BY MEANS OF THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE AND SO PROMINENT A PART DOES IT FORM OF THEIR GROVES AND SO THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS MEN WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO WALK AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP IS PASSED ROUND AND SO THOUGH YOU COULD HEAR THEM AND SMELL THEM AND SO TWILL BE WHEN I AM GONE THAT TUNEFUL PEAL WILL STILL RING ON AND SO WITH PLENTY OF TIME PLENTY OF MONEY AND SOLE BUYING THE FOREIGN COMMODITIES UPON THE PLACE THEY RAISE THE PRICE OF THOSE AND ABATE THE PRICE OF THESE AND SOME INDIAN PREPARATIONS IN WHICH THE FLESH OF ANIMALS AND SOME NEW SCHEME OF EXPLORATION HAD NOW BROUGHT HER TO FORT RELIANCE AND SOME SIXTY SOLDIERS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE HUDSON S BAY COMPANY AND SOMETHING LIKE THE SMOKE OF TOWNS OR IS IT ONLY CLOUD DRIFT AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED AND SOON BEGAN TO MAKE WAR UPON THEM IN THEIR USUAL MURDERING PLUNDERING STYLE AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE COULD FEEL SECURE EVEN FOR A WEEK AND SOON THE WHOLE PALACE WAS BURIED IN SLEEP AND SPANKED THE ELEPHANT S CHILD WITH HIS SCALESOME FLAILSOME TAIL AND SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL ENERGY COMPANIES AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION AND STAINLESS VIRTUE HIS ELABORATE WORKS HAVE LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN AND STAND UPRIGHT ON THE UPPER BRANCHES FULL GROWN TREES FAVORABLY SITUATED AS TO SOIL AND EXPOSURE AND STATICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH APPLY TO MOLAR MOTION AND REST AND STELLAR PHENOMENA INDEPENDENT OF THE SOURCES OF ERROR ATTENDANT ON ORDINARY OBSERVATION IN AND STICKS TO THE TEETH IT IS CERTAINLY INFERIOR AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD AND STILL DEEPER THE MEANING OF THAT STORY OF NARCISSUS WHO BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GRASP THE AND STILL HE WAS FULL OF SATIABLE CURTIOSITY AND STILL I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CROCODILE HAS FOR DINNER AND STREAKED WITH CRYSTAL BALSAM THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN POURED UPON EACH CONE FROM ABOVE AND STRIKING A LIGHT GAVE HIM A SMOKE OUT OF MY OWN PIPE AND STRUGGLED TO LAND WITH IT WHEN ALL WAS READY FOR A START ONCE MORE AND STUDY PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FORESTS AND STUFFED IT INTO HIS OWN MOUTH VANTAGE NUMBER TWO AND STUFFED VEAL OF THE OLD WORLD AND SUCH AS THEY COULD NOT ANSWER FOR AND THIS IS ALL I SHALL SAY CONCERNING SYSTEMS AND ASSEMBLIES OF PEOPLE AND SUCH ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FORCES ARE OFTEN SPOKEN OF AND SUCH INJURY RECEIVED IN THE BACK AS ROUSED THE MOST ALARMING IDEAS AND SUFFICIENTLY ILLUMINATED THE MISTY ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM ATTENDING THESE MEETINGS AND SUNG BY THE BARDS OF THE TIME OF OSSIAN AND SUPERINDUCE NEW NATURES UPON THE OLD FOUNDATIONS AND SUPPLY THE GREATER NUMBER OF FURS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE HUDSON S BAY COMPANY AND SURVEYED THE CUSHIONS THE OARS THE ROWLOCKS AND ALL THE FASCINATING FITTINGS AND SUSTAIN THE CONCLUSION ALREADY ARRIVED AT ON THE QUESTION OF EXTENSION IN AND SWIMMING BEHIND PROPELLED THE HELPLESS ANIMAL TO SHORE HAULED HIM OUT AND TAKE CARE OF HIM IT IS ANNE S OWN PROPOSAL AND TAKES IT AWAY ON THE OTHER AND TAKES PLACE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THAT FORCE IS EXERTED AND THAT AND TEN FEET IN DIAMETER TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND TEN TO ONE IT CARRIES YOU DOWN IN A DALE AND LEAVES YOU THERE BY A POOL IN THE STREAM AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSITIONAL FORMS PRESENTED BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY AND THAT A DETACHMENT OF THE LIEUTENANT S MEN AND THAT A LIQUID BODY BECOMES SOLID AND THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE EMBROIDERED AND VERY EXPENSIVE AND THAT BECAUSE MR ELLIOT S MANNERS HAD PRECISELY PLEASED HER IN THEIR PROPRIETY AND CORRECTNESS AND THAT FEW SIGHS WERE WASTED ON ME AND THAT HE CAN SAVE IN OTHER WAYS BESIDES WITH SWORD AND SPEAR AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT AND THAT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE PROCLAIMED AS SOON AND THAT IN THE LONG SUBSEQUENT QUATERNARY EPOCH AN ARCTIC CLIMATE WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENT OF GIGANTIC GLACIERS AND THAT IS THE END OF THAT TALE AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY WHALES NOWADAYS NEVER EAT MEN AND THAT IS THE WAY WE SOLVE THE SOLUTION AND THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING TODAY AND THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO TEAZE HIM AND THAT NO WAY OF REACHING THAT PLACE WOULD OFFER TILL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND THAT OF IMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LEVIATHAN AND THAT ON NO ACCOUNT CAN A MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVEN AND THAT ONLY BY THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IF A SOVEREIGN MONARCH AND THAT SUCH PROPORTION BEARS A SIMPLE RELATION TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS ALL HARMONISED AND THAT THE ELEMENTARY UNITS ARE BROADLY SPEAKING PERMANENT WHIRLPOOLS OR VORTICES OF THIS ETHER AND THAT THE FLEET SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SAIL FROM THE ISLAND AND THAT THE INCREASING DROUGHT WILL OF ITSELF EXTINGUISH SEQUOIA LEAVING ITS GROUND TO OTHER TREES AND THAT THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SEVERAL KINDS OF MATTER WERE ALWAYS THE SAME AND THAT THE WICKED MONARCH HAS LEARNED TO SEAT HIMSELF GINGERLY UPON HIS BOMB INFESTED THRONE AND THAT THEREFORE IT WILL REST OR CONTINUE IN MOTION AND THAT THEY PROBABLY ARE VERGING TO EXTINCTION BUT THE VERGE OF A PERIOD BEGINNING IN CRETACEOUS TIMES AND THAT TO NONE OF THESE TRUTHS IS THERE ANY APPROXIMATION IN BACON S ESSAY IN AND THAT TWO ATOMS MAY CONCEIVABLY OCCUPY THE SAME SPACE AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT AND THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO FORD OR GO ROUND THEM AND THAT WHATEVER ENERGY IS EXERTED IN PRODUCING SUCH PHENOMENA AND THAT WHICH IS SAID HERE OF THE RIGHTS OF AN ASSEMBLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE AND THAT WHICH PRESCRIBETH THE LIMITS THEREOF IS THE POWER SOVEREIGN FOR POWER UNLIMITED IS ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY AND AND THAT WILL BE A GREAT HELP AND THAT YOU MUST GET A BALL DRESS FOR A BALL AND A STREET DRESS TO WALK IN AND THE AIR IS ENTANGLED IN MASSES AND BROAD SHEETS THAT ARE QUICKLY SATURATED AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY AND THE AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT KINETIC ENERGY WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED BEFORE IT STRIKES THE EARTH AND THE ANIMALS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO WORK FOR MAN AND THE ATTEMPT OF LE SAGE IN THE LAST CENTURY AND THE BEAUTY OF WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN THE LIGHT AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS AND THE BIG PURPLE BURS ARE RIPENING IN THE MELLOW LIGHT AND THE BINNACLE BATS WORE WATER PROOF HATS AS THEY DANCED IN THE SOUNDING SEA AND THE BISQUE CLOTH SURELY MADAME HAD FOUND GREAT SATISFACTION IN WEARING THE BISQUE AND THE BOB HAS ONLY POTENTIAL ENERGY AND THE BODIES WE CALL LIGHT AT LEAST SUCH AS SMOKE AND

WAS APPARENTLY MAD FOR HE SAT ON THE AFTER RAIL AND THE HOST OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL BE DEAD BODIES TO BE EATEN BY THE BIRDS AND THE BEASTS AND THE INFINITELY SMALL BETWEEN WHICH OUR LITTLE RACE OF LIFE IS RUN AND THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY WAS RESUMED NO INCIDENT WORTH MENTIONING OCCURRED AND THE INVENTION OF INSTRUMENTS OF INFINITE DELICACY AND THE INVENTION OF NEW ONES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVEN MORE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE JOY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSES OF THINGS SUNG BY THE OLD POETS AND THE KINGS DAUGHTER SHALL BE HIS WIFE AND DAVID SAID AND THE LAST OF THE DESCRIPTION AND THE LAST WE SAW OF HIM THE MAN IN BLUE WAS DRAGGING HIM AWAY BY THE COAT COLLAR LECTURING HIM AGAIN AND THE LEOPARD SCLUSIVELY WITH HIS TEETH AND CLAWS AND THE LEOPARD SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND SAID AND THE LEOPARD WAS MORE EXCITED THAN EVER AND THE LIEUTENANT NOT ONLY GRANTED IT AND THE LONG WHITE PLAINS STRETCHING BETWEEN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE AND THE MAGISTRATE REPREHENDED THEM FOR IT IN THESE WORDS QUOTE AND THE MAY FLY WAS VISIBLE NO MORE NEITHER WAS THE OTTER THE MOLE LOOKED DOWN AND THE MISTRESS OF A VERY PRETTY LANDAULETTE AND THE MOLE WAS INDEED VERY GLAD TO OBEY FOR HE HAD STARTED HIS SPRING CLEANING AT A VERY EARLY HOUR THAT MORNING AND THE MOLE S EYES WERE ABLE TO WANDER OFF THE TABLE CLOTH A LITTLE AND THE MORE FROM ITS NOT OVERPOWERING YOU AT THE TIME AND THE MORE I SAW THE MORE I FOUND TO ADMIRE AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILISATION AND THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE OF HARD WORKERS MAY THINK HE HAS DONE WELL AND THE MOTIVE FOR THIS REDUCTION INQUIRED THE TRAVELLER AND THE NATIVES WAPITIS HE IS QUITE RIGHT ADDED MARBRE AND THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WHICH TIME AND SPACE OFFER TO MUTUAL INTERCOURSE AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS HATING HERSELF FOR THE FOLLY WHICH ASKED THE QUESTION AND THE NOISE WAS LOUDER THAN SEVERAL BRASS BANDS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF GREAT GEOLOGICAL CHANGES AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS BULGING SEEMS IN SOME CASES EXCESSIVE AND THE OTHER ANIMALS ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME THAT I M A MEAN BEAST AND CUT IT VERY FINE AND THE OTTER HAULED HIMSELF OUT AND SHOOK THE WATER FROM HIS COAT GREEDY BEGGARS AND THE PAIR FLUNG FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THE PARSEE LEFT THAT CAKE AND CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A PALM TREE AND THE PARSEE LIVED BY THE RED SEA WITH NOTHING BUT HIS HAT AND HIS KNIFE AND THE PASSENGERS WERE ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND THE PHILISTINE CURSED DAVID BY THE GODS OF HIS PEOPLE AND DAVID ANSWERED HIM AND THE PHYSICIST WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HARVEY IN ITALY WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED GREECE AND THE POOR CREATURES WHO COULD HARDLY BE HELD IN WHEN THEY STARTED AND THE PRESENT DAY THERE IS NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR BELIEVING THAT THE OLDEST REMAINS YET OBTAINED AND THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF COLONEL WALLIS S GALLANTRY WAS QUITE CONTENTED AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED BY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS OF A PRECISION AND REFINEMENT AND THE RAFT HE WAS SITTING ON AND THE RAT WAS VERY PLEASED TO INDULGE HIM AND TO SPRAWL AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GRASS AND REST AND THE REALLY TRULY TWIRLY WHIRLY EEL AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN OH FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE AND THE REDHEADED DUCKS OF WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY SPECIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE REINS WERE THEREFORE AGAIN AND THE RELATION OF THESE SUCCESSIVE FORMS AND THE REST OF THE CARAVAN FOLLOWED AT A RAPID PACE AND THE RHINOCEROS UPSET THE OIL STOVE WITH HIS NOSE AND THE SCATTERED SPECIMENS OF THE FLORA OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND THE SECOND BLESSING WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY AND THE SERGEANT WAS ALMOST UPSET BY A SLEDGE AND THE SINCERITY OF HER MANNER BEING SOON SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE HIM AND THE SKATE AND HIS MATE AND THE MACKEREEL AND THE PICKEREEL AND THE SKY SEEN THROUGH THE GARDEN OPENING SEEMS ONE VAST MEADOW OF WHITE LILY STARS AND THE SLEDGES DRAWN BY THEIR SWIFT TEAMS AND THE SOIL IS MOSTLY CALCAREOUS AND THE STATE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MEANS THE CONDITION OF THE BOB DURING THE INSTANT AT WHICH THE ENERGY AND THE STEWARD FALLS INTO THE SOUP TUREEN AND THE SUPPOSED CONSTANCY OF THE ELEMENTARY ATOMS DURING THE ENORMOUS LAPSE OF TIME MEASURED BY THE EXISTENCE OF OUR UNIVERSE AND THE SWIFTEST HORSE COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT THEM UP AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NIGHTS WAS NO LONGER BELOW FREEZING POINT AND THE TENDENCY OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE IS CLEARLY TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD AND THE TOWN HAS GOT TO BURY THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN T FIND THE FATHER RIGHT OFF QUICK AND JACKY HAS GOT TO GO TO THE POOR FARM THIS AFTERNOON AND AND THE TRUNKS BEGIN TO SLIDE AND THE TWO ANIMALS WERE FRIENDS FORTHWITH SUCH A RUMPUS EVERYWHERE CONTINUED THE OTTER AND THE TWO USED TO HUNT TOGETHER THE AND THE USE OF ARMS OF PRECISION JUST AS MUCH AS IT DOES AND THE VERY NEXT ONE EMPTY THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THEM RIGHT WOULD BE TO LET ALL THE BABIES AND THE WATERFALLS CREATED BY THE ACTION OF THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND THE WEARY HEATED TRAVELER FINDS BUT LITTLE PROTECTION IN THEIR SHADE AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AND THE WEEPING AND WAILING AND TEETH GNASHING THERE AND THE WHALE FELT MOST UNHAPPY INDEED HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN AND THE WHITE CLIFFS OF ALBION AND HE RUSHED HALF WAY UP AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES AND THE ZEBRA AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO AND THE HARTEBEEST LIVED THERE AND THE ZEBRA FOR TRAVELLING AND THE BLUE AND SILVER AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL SHE WAS ASSISTED HOWEVER AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT AND THEIR COLOR CHANGES TO A WARM YELLOWISH BROWN AND THEIR DEPORTMENT IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THEIR DEBUTANTE SISTER AND THEIR EXPRESSION IN RULES OR LAWS THE THIRD IS THE EXPLICATION OF THESE PARTICULAR LAWS BY DEDUCTION FROM THE MOST GENERAL LAWS OF MATTER AND MOTION AND THEIR IMPORTANCE RECOGNISED AND THEIR MARRIAGE INSTEAD OF DEPRIVING HER OF ONE FRIEND AND THEIR SKIN WHICH IS NOT QUITE SO THICK AS THAT OF THE ELK AND THEIR VISIT IN GENERAL THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC SINGING AND THEN BITTEN OFF BREAD AND BUTTER BREAD SHOULD ALWAYS BE BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES WITH THE FINGERS BEFORE BEING EATEN AND THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SANDS AND THEN HE SMACKED HIS LIPS SO AND THEN HE WENT AWAY AND THEN INDEED YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE INFINITE VARIETY AND THEN IT WAS JUST BEFORE THEY PARTED AND THEN LICK OR BITE IT OFF PIECEMEAL THIS MUST ON NO ACCOUNT BE PERMITTED AND THEN MR PERKINS WAS MERCILESSLY PELTED WITH ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE CHOICE OF THE POOR FARM AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR A BABY AND THEN ON WINTER NIGHTS WHEN THE NORTHEASTER WHIPS THE WATER INTO FROTH TO SWOOP DOWN AND THEN ONLY IF STAYING AT AN ULTRA FASHIONABLE HOTEL AND THEN ONLY WHEN YOU KNEW PRECISELY WHERE TO LOOK AND THEN SCAMPERED AS FAST AS HE COULD GO LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP AND THEN SHE SUPPOSED THEY MUST MEET AND THEN SHE WILL DECORATE IT WITH EVERYTHING IN THE WAY OF MILLINERY AND JEWELRY THAT SHE CAN LAY HER HANDS ON AND THEN SHOOT UP PARALLEL WITH THE AXIS VERY OLD TREES ARE USUALLY DEAD AT THE TOP AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW AND THEN STUMBLE UPON YOU FELLOWS AT LEAST I BEG PARDON I DON T EXACTLY MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THERE AND THEN THE LEOPARD HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SNIFFILY IN THE STARLIGHT AND THEN THERE S BADGER OF COURSE HE LIVES RIGHT IN THE HEART OF IT AND THEN THIS ASSEMBLY IS A BODY POLITIC AND THEIR POWER LIMITED BY COMMISSION AND THEN TO THE OTHER KNOCKED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE SLEDGE AND THEN TURN ON THE COMPUTER AND THEN WIPE HIS LIPS AND FINGERS ON THE APRON OF HIS BIB AND THEN YOU WILL PERHAPS SEE AS MANY AS YOU CARE ABOUT AND THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROPOSING ONESELF AND SURRENDERING AS A PRIZE AND THERE BEING NO SUFFICIENT REASON AGAINST IT HE OUGHT TO GO AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYING AND BEING PAID AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A CORNER FOR ME AND I KNOW THERE IS ONE FOR YOU AND THERE THEY HID AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE WEENY BABY THAT DIED WITH HER AND EMMA JANE AND I PUT FLOWERS AROUND THEM AND DID THE BEST WE COULD AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF HER BUT HER VOICE AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF REINDEER IN THE POLAR REGIONS AND THERE S ALWAYS CLOTHES LEFT OVER FROM THE OLD BABY TO BEGIN THE NEW ONE ON AND THERE S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT AND THEREFORE ARE LIABLE TO BE SWEPT BY FIRE THIRD THERE ARE NO SEEDLINGS OR SAPLINGS AND THEREFORE NO OTHER CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PART OF THEM AND THEREFORE SOMEHOW THEY HARDLY KNEW HOW AND THEREFORE THE GRANT WERE EITHER VOYD AS PROCEEDING FROM ERROR COMMONLY INCIDENT TO HUMANE NATURE AND THEREFORE WHEN IN ONE COMMON WEALTH THERE BE DIVERS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THEIR LAWS DISTINCT ONE FROM ANOTHER AND THEREFORE WHERE THERE IS ONCE A SOVEREIGNTY THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BUT BY IT AND THESE ARE HUNG WITH INNUMERABLE SLENDER SWAYING SPRAYS THAT ARE HANDSOMELY FEATHERED AND THESE EXHIBITIONS ENDEARED HIM TO THE COMMON PEOPLE AND THESE NOBLE FORESTS WOULD BE WANTING MANY GROVES AND THICKETS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE GROWN UP ON LAKE AND AVALANCHE BEDS AND THESE WORDS UNDERNEATH THE SPOUTER INN PETER COFFIN COFFIN AND THEY ACQUIRED AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHEN THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND THEY ALL SPANKED HIM ONCE MORE FOR LUCK AND THEY ARE BASED ON THE NETWORK AND THEY ARE CREEPING ME OUT AND THEY ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS AND THEY ARE GOING TO THE STORM CELLARS AND THEY ARE NEVER COMING BACK AND THEY ARE NOT GREATLY HIGHER THAN THE SPRING FLOODMARKS OF THE PRESENT AND THEY ARE PREPARED FOR AN EXCHANGE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN AND THEY COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS COMPARATIVELY FERTILE REGION AND THEY DIDN T LISTEN TO ME AND THEY DISSOLVED PARTNERSHIP BUT RICHARD CAPTURED ASCALON AFTER THIS AND THEY DON T SAY A WORD AND THEY EMBITTERED HIS LIFE AS THE SONS OF A TOO FROLICSOME FATHER ARE APT TO DO AND THEY GREW IN A STATELY LINE BENEATH THE FOUR KITCHEN WINDOWS THEIR TAPERING TIPS SET THICKLY WITH GAY SATIN CIRCLETS OF PINK OR LAVENDER OR CRIMSON AND THEY HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE VILLAGE AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND THEY HELD A PALAVER AND AN INDABA AND A PUNCHAYET AND THEY OPEN UP A VAST FIELD FOR FUTURE INQUIRY AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON AND THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE NURSERY TO PLAY FAIR IN GAMES AND THEY SPANKED HIM IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEY WENT SEVERAL MILES OUT OF THEIR ROUTE TOWARDS THE EAST AND THEY WERE AFTER WHAT SHE SAW AND THEY WERE ALL PROPERLY ARRANGED AND THEY WERE SCLUSIVELY SANDY YELLOW BROWNISH ALL OVER BUT THE LEOPARD AND THINK UP SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK ME TOMORROW MORNING AND THIS BEING CONSTANTLY AUGMENTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR BY THE VARYING ACTION OF THE SUNLIGHT WINDS SNOW STORMS ETC AND THIS ENERGY MAY BE SAID TO BE ENERGY OF POSITION AND THIS FACT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR HER HABITUALLY TO WEAR IT AND THIS FLOATSAM AND JETSAM OF THE TIDE OF INVESTIGATION AND THIS INSTANCE IS BY NO MEANS A RARE ONE BUT AND THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THIS IS THE COMMONEST CASE BECAUSE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT ARE HARD WORK AND THIS IS THE KEY TO IT ALL AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED HERE AND THIS IS WHERE SHE LIVES NOW AND THIS IT WAS THAT SPECIALLY OCCUPIED ME AS I DRESSED FOR DINNER THIS EVENING AND THIS LESSENED THE SEVERITY OF THE COLD AND THIS NUMBER IS NOW REDUCED BY ONE HALF AT LEAST AND THIS REVELATION TO SIGHT AND TOUCH AND THIS SELF ANNIHILATION SUITED HIS PASSIVE TEMPERAMENT AND THIS SURPRISES ME A MAN LIKE HIM IN HIS SITUATION AND THIS TENDENCY AGAIN IS MAINLY A PRODUCT OF THE INCREASING STRENGTH AND THIS VIEW OF THE DUALITY OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL AND THOMAS BLACK RELIED UPON HIS FAITHFUL DOGS TO LOSE NOTHING BY THE WAY AND THOSE UNOBTRUSIVE BUT PREGNANT OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS AND THOSE WHO MOST DISLIKED HIM PREFERRED HIS UNPRINCIPLED LEVITY TO THE STERN AND EARNEST BIGOTRY AND THOSE WHO STILL REPEAT THE ONCE FAVORITE OBJECTION THAT DARWIN S ORIGIN OF SPECIES AND THOUGH CHARLES HAD ANSWERED FOR THE CHILD S BEING IN NO SUCH STATE AS COULD MAKE IT INCONVENIENT AND THOUGH IN THIS MATTER POOR OLD NANTUCKET IS NOW MUCH BEHIND HER AND THOUGH MR ROBINSON FELT AND FELT AND RUBBED AND THOUGH THIS PINE TREE SHAKES DOWN ITS SIGHS LIKE LEAVES UPON THIS SHEPHERD S HEAD AND THOUGHTS AT SUCH TIMES SEEMED TO HER AS A SIN AND THRICE REBUILT BY HER LOVER TO GRATIFY HER CAPRICE AND THRUST IN A LITTLE LINT HERE AND THERE AND THUS SHOOK THE ANCIENT DOCTRINE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS IN AND THUS VIRTUALLY TO GO UP HILL AND THUS WE STOOD LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM AND TO BASK IN THE SUNBEAMS AND TO BE ABLE TO PART AND EAT THEIR DINNER IN TOLERABLE EASE OF MIND AND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE BALTIC AT THIS UNEARTHLY TIME OF YEAR HAD AND TO BUY EVERYTHING THAT TEMPTS YOU WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT OR NOT AND TO CONSIDER THE LATTER NOT AS IDEAL TRUTHS THE REAL ENTITIES OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD BEHIND PHENOMENA AND TO DEFINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLOTHES THAT ARE NOTABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTINCTION AND SMARTNESS AND TO DIVIDE THE DOMINION CONTRARY TO THEIR PEACE AND DEFENSE WHICH THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO DOE AND TO ESTABLISH A FACTORY AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT AND TO FIND WHICH THESE ARE IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A SAMPLE OF EACH MATERIAL AND TO FOUND A FORT ON THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT AND TO GENERALISE THE FACTS OBSERVED BY SAYING THAT BODIES WHICH ARE FREE TO MOVE AND TO GIVE HIM SOME TASTE OF THAT EMOTION WHICH WAS REDDENING ANNE S CHEEKS AND TO GIVE LEAVE TO A BODY POLITIC OF SUBJECTS TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE AND TO GO TO SLEEP UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING AND TO INDICATE THE PATH WHICH IT MUST FOLLOW AND TO LEAVE TO THE COMPANY ONLY THAT PORTION OF ITS LAND AND TO OPERATE AT A DISTANCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TEND TO DRAW ANY TWO SUCH MASSES TOGETHER AND TO PITY EVERY ONE AS BEING LESS HAPPY THAN HERSELF AND TO SAY THAT SHE HAS MORE INFLUENCE IN AMERICA AND TO SOME EXTENT BY TUFTS OF SLENDER SPRAYS THAT WAVE LIGHTLY IN THE WINDS AND TO SUCK THEM OR SMEAR ONE S NAPKIN IS EQUALLY UNSIGHTLY ON THE SUBJECT OF ELBOWS AND TO TAKE UP A NEW SET OF OPINIONS AND OF HOPES AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED PERIOD AND TOO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR MODESTY TO BE NATURAL IN ANY OTHER WOMAN AND TOOK A BEARING ACROSS THE DESERT AND FOUND THE CAMEL MOST SCRUCIATINGLY IDLE AND TOOK IT BY TURNS TO SIT UP AT NIGHT IN THE KING S ROOM AND TOOK THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION TOGETHER WITH THEIR CHIEF TENAYA BUT AFTER A SHORT STAY AND TORE OFF THE TOPS OF THE ICEBERGS AND TORRICELLI HAD WEIGHED THE AIR MALPIGHI AND GREW AND TOSSING RIPE CONES AMONG THE ASHES AND CINDERS OF NATURE S HEARTHS AND TOUCHES OF SLATY BLUE AND TOWARDS THE FRONTIERS OF UPPER CANADA ON LAKES ATHAPESKOW AND TRANSPORT ON THE OTHER HAND THE EXPLORATION OF CORAL REEFS AND OF THE DEPOSITS NOW TAKING PLACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT OCEANS AND TREATMENT OF THAT DISEASE SO THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSE OF SPLENIC FEVER AND TRY SO THE ELEPHANT S CHILD WENT HOME ACROSS AFRICA AND TRY TO BE FEELING LESS EIGHT YEARS AND TUOLUMNE GROVES THEN THE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OF THE GRAND ANCIENT MER DE GLACE AND TURNED HIM RAPIDLY ON TO HIS FACE AND BACK AGAIN WITH THE WORDS AND TURNED HIS BACK AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THAT S JUST THE SORT OF FELLOW HE IS AND TURNED ROUND THREE TIMES ON HIS TAIL AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG EXCEEDINGLY HARD AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS AND TWO OR THREE SEMI EVENING DRESSES TO PUT ON AND TWO THIN ONES WITH A LONG COAT AND A DRESS AND UNCONCERNED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WITH FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND UNLESS IN CASE OF NECESSITY ALTOGETHER UNDESIRABLE AND UNLIKE THE FUR GATHERING STRANGERS THEY HAD HITHERTO KNOWN CARING NOTHING ABOUT TRADE AND UP FROM YONDER COTTAGE GOES A SLEEPY SMOKE AND USED IT AS FLY WHISK AND HE MADE HIMSELF A NEW AND VAST NUMBERS OF COMPOUNDS SOME OF THEM PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ONLY AS PRODUCTS OF THE LIVING ECONOMY AND VICE VERSA IT IS TO BE NOTED HOWEVER AND W PLUS X PLUS Y THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT AND SO ON AND WALK NOT RUN OUT OF THE ROOM AND WANDERS OUT AMONG THE VOLCANOES OF THE GREAT BASIN AND WARMEST PORTIONS OF THE MAIN GLACIAL SOIL BELT I CANNOT SAY AND WAS ABOUT TO CARRY IT INTO THE HOUSE AND WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE OF THE REST OF THE PARTY AND WAS EVEN IN THE DECLINE OF LIFE AN INDEFATIGABLE WALKER AND WAS GETTING A BIT RESTLESS BESIDES AND PRESENTLY HE SAID RATTY PLEASE AND WAS GIVEN OUT AS THEY COOLED AND WHICH MOREOVER WAS CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO A SORT OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THEM AND SO BECOMING LATENT AND WAS GOING ON WELL THE NEXT DAY AND WAS GOING TO SAIL AMONG SOME DREARY MUD FLATS SOMEWHERE ON THE EAST COAST AND WAS JUST THE SIZE FOR TWO ANIMALS AND THE MOLE S WHOLE HEART WENT OUT TO IT AT ONCE AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND WAS NOW MUCH IN THE SAME SITUATION AND WAS TAKEN TO A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND WAS TALL AND STRONGLY BUILT AND WAS THOUGHT BY THE PHYSICIANS TO BE OUT OF DANGER AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE AND WE ALL FELT ILL AS MARINERS WILL ON A DIET THAT S CHEAP AND RUDE AND WE ALL HAD TO GO AND STAY WITH HIM IN HIS HOUSE BOAT AND WE BOTH KNOW IT AND WE CANNOT TOO CAREFULLY TAKE THE LESSON TO HEART AND WE HAVE AS YET SEEN NONE OF THE WONDERS IT CONTAINS AND WE LEFT THE CREW OF THE JUNK TO CHEW THE BARK OF THE RUBAGUB TREE AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN I HOPE THEY FROZE TO DEATH IN THE ARCTIC SEAS AND WE SAT ON THE EDGE OF A SANDY LEDGE AND SHOT AT THE WHISTLING BEE AND WE SHALL ARRIVE IN PLENTY OF TIME TO PICK UP THE VANQUISHED AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND WE SHIVERED AND SHOOK AS WE DIPPED THE COOK IN A TUB OF HIS GLUESOME FOOD AND WELCOMING HIM TO ALL THAT WAS STRONGEST AND BEST IN HIS CELLARS AND WENT BACK AGAIN TO SERVE SARAI AND WENT ON AND WERE ABLE TO ENDURE THEIR BEAVER LIKE EXISTENCE AND WERE ABOUT TO DISCONTINUE THEIR EXHAUSTING EFFORTS AND WERE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE NETS AND SNARES AND WERE CAUGHT AND HELD AGAIN ALL WAS A SHAKE AND A SHIVER AND WERE COMPELLED TO GO AROUND THEM WHICH CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DELAY AND WERE HORRIBLY BRUISED AND SHAKEN AND WERE OBLIGED TO BE CONTENT WITH THE GAME WHICH PASSED WITHIN RANGE OF THEIR RIFLES AND WETTER SOIL THAN ITS RIVALS BUT REQUIRES MORE SUNSHINE THAN THEY THE LATTER FACT BEING CLEARLY SHOWN AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT IS MORE AND WHAT IS THE RESULTING EQUATION AND WHAT IT DOESN T KNOW IS NOT WORTH KNOWING LORD THE TIMES WE VE HAD TOGETHER AND WHAT LAWYER IS HANDLING THIS IN YOUR PRESENCE AND WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY AND WHAT WAS IT TO HER IF AND WHAT WOULD I HAVE FOUND AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO KNOW HIM BETTER AND WHEN HE KNOCKED IT DOWN IT KICKED LIKE ZEBRA BUT HE COULDN T SEE IT AND WHEN HER OWN MISTRESS AGAIN WHEN ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AND WHEN I EXPRESSED MY INTENTION OF GOING THITHER CHEERFULLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPANY ME AND WHEN IT IS THAT WHICH IN THIS PLACE I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS AND WHEN IT SHALL BE DECLARED THAT NOTHING MORE SHALL BE PROPOUNDED NOR DEBATED BY THEM AND WHEN ONE IS NOT GOING ON TO A BALL AFTERWARD AND WHEN REBECCA STOLE IN AND PLACED THE FLOWERY GARLAND ALL ALONG THE EDGE OF THE RUDE BIER AND WHEN THE AGENTS AND SOLDIERS OF RIVAL ASSOCIATIONS DISPUTED THE POSSESSION OF THE RICH FUR COUNTRY AND WHEN THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE BEGINNING WAS OVER AND WHEN THE GIRAFFE OR THE ZEBRA OR THE ELAND OR THE KOODOO OR THE BUSH BUCK AND WHEN THE JOB HAD BEEN DONE AGAIN THE RAT POINTED OUT A FORK WHICH AND WHEN THE OLD CHIEF WAS ASKED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE REST OF HIS BAND AND WHEN THE SUN SHINES UPON THEM AT THE REQUIRED ANGLE AND WHEN TIRED AT LAST HE SAT ON THE BANK WHILE THE RIVER STILL CHATTERED ON TO HIM AND WHEN WE SAW THAT THE KEEPERS STOPPED THE PEOPLE FROM SPITTING AND SMOKING AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN AND WHEN YOU STAND BACK FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE MASSIVE COLUMNS FROM THE SWELLING INSTEP AND WHEN YOU VE DONE IT THERE S ALWAYS SOMETHING ELSE TO DO AND YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU LIKE AND WHENEVER HE ESPIES HER IN HIS LOFTY FLIGHT YOU MAY SEE HIM DART DOWN UPON HER AND WHERE BUT FROM NANTUCKET TOO DID THAT FIRST ADVENTUROUS LITTLE SLOOP PUT FORTH AND WHERE BUT ONE BUYETH THE CHEAPER SUCH CORPORATIONS THEREFORE ARE NO OTHER THEN MONOPOLIES AND WHERE IT IS LIKELY NO ONE WILL BE ASKED IN AND WHEREAS IN NATIONS NOT THOROUGHLY CIVILIZED SEVERAL NUMEROUS FAMILIES HAVE LIVED IN CONTINUAL HOSTILITY AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS AND WHEREVER SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS SERIES OF THE REMAINS OF ANY GIVEN GROUP AND WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AND WHICH WOULD THEREFORE BE A REAL EPICUREAN CHANCE WORLD AND WHILE SEARCHING THE WIDE BASIN OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AND AND WHILE SO FAR AWAY THAT THE GIANT COULD NOT REACH HIM WITH SWORD OR SPEAR TO STRIKE HIM DOWN WITH A WEAPON WHICH THE GIANT WOULD NOT EXPECT AND WHILE THESE PRIME SUPPLIES OF GOOD REMAINED AND WHILST THE SERGEANT WENT TO FETCH THE SNOW AND WHILST THE SPIRITS THUS FREELY CIRCULATED AND WHO COULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AT PRESENT AND WHO HAD EXPECTED THAT ON SUCH A DAY HIS COURT AND WHOSE AMBITION IS MERELY TO BE WELL ENOUGH DRESSED TO FIT IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND AND WHY AND WHO I SEND THEM OVER LAND AND SEA AND WILL BE MADE BY MEN WHO SEEK KNOWLEDGE AND WILL MANIFEST ITSELF WHEN THE STONE IS SET FREE AND WILL POSSESS KINETIC ENERGY AND WILL RETURN A FULLY EXECUTED COPY TO YOU AND WIN HIM TO CONVERSE BUT IT WAS NOT IN HER POWER AND WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS COMPATIBLE WITH ANXIOUS ELEGANCE AND WITH ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS WHICH DURING OUR TIME HAVE PUT BEYOND DOUBT AND WITH FRESH ASSURANCES OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO SERVE HIM AND WITH RESPECT TO THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RESINOUS PINUS CONTORTA SEQUOIA SUFFERS MOST OF ALL AND WITH THE FIRST DAWN OF DAY PEACE WAS RESTORED AND WITH THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED PORTION OF THE CURVE MANY TIMES LONGER THAN THE OLD PORTION AND WITH UTMOST PROPRIETY CONTINUE THE FEAT AND WORDS TO HIS LIPS AND WOULD DEVOTE THEMSELVES BODY AND SOUL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER BUT SOME PITYING DEITY AND WOULD NOT BE PREPARED FOR DAVID TOOK HIS SHEPHERD S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WOULD YOU MIND CALLING AT LANCASTER S AND ASKING FOR MINE AND BRINGING IT TOO AND WRAPPED IT ALL UP IN COOL BANANA LEAVES AND WRITE

HAPPY HER SPRING OF FELICITY WAS IN THE GLOW OF HER SPIRITS AND YET DIFFERENT PRIMARY FORMS IN THE LIVING WORLD FACTS OF THIS KIND ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN EVOLUTION FROM A COMMON PROTOTYPE AND YET I AM SURE AND YET I WAS NOT SEEN MY THREAD IS CUT AND YET IT WAS NOT SPUN AND YET I WAS PUZZLED TO FIND THAT SOMEWHERE WITHIN ME THERE WAS A FAINT LIGHTENING OF THE SPIRITS AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY AND YET IN ALLOWANCE FOR HIS FEELINGS SO PLEASANTLY AND YET IT HATH NOT SPRUNG THE FRUIT IS DEAD AND YET THE LEAVES ARE GREEN AND YET IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE STONE TENDS TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EARTH AND YET NO DOUBT IT IS SOMETIMES THE BEST THING FOR A CITY TO BE CONQUERED AND YET OTHERS DISCOURSE WITH THE HANDS WHEN THEY COME QUITE CLOSE TO THE GLASS YOU CAN HEAR THEM AND YET THAT WOULD NOT KEEP OUT THE TEMPESTUOUS EUROCLYDON AND YET THERE IS NO SYNONYM THAT WILL EXPRESS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF BEAUTIFUL TASTE COMBINED WITH PERSONAL DIGNITY AND GRACE AND YET THERE IS ONE

LUMBERMEN WITH THEIR SAW MILLS HAVE BEEN LESS GENERALLY DESTRUCTIVE THUS FAR THAN THE SHINGLE MAKERS BUT THE SCLUSIVELY BARE HOT SHINY HIGH VELDT BUT THE SIERRA AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BARE ROCKY DESERT BUT THE STUDY OF THE PROCESS OF TAKING TO PIECES BUT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS FURNISHED BY OBSERVATION BUT THE SUGAR PINE SEEMS TOO UNCONSCIOUSLY NOBLE AND TOO COMPLETE IN EVERY WAY BUT THE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHY WHICH AT THE PRESENT TIME BRINGS ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD BUT THE TERRIBLE AGENCY OF THE PARASITIC FUNGI AND OF THE INFINITESIMALLY MINUTE MICROBES BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT WE HAD DRIFTED APART FROM THE NATURE OF THINGS BUT THE VARYING RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENTS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN SUCH INTERVALS AND APPEAR TO THE ORDINARY SENSE INSTANTANEOUS IS RECORDED BUT THE VISITOR WHO HAD ARRIVED IN SO STRANGE A MANNER BUT THE WINDOW IS SELECTED FOR CAPTURE BUT THE WOMAN WHO GOES ABROAD PERHAPS EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IS APT TO BE DEFICIENT BUT THEIR ABSENCE WAS ATONED FOR BY ITS HUGE PROPORTIONS BUT THEIR NAKEDNESS WAS DISGUISED BY ARMS AND ARMOUR BUT THEIR POWERS OF PERSUASION WERE SUCH THAT THE MOST RELUCTANT YIELDED IN THE END BUT THEIR SUCCESSORS TRANSPORT ONE INTO A NEW WORLD THAT WHICH CHARACTERISES THE NEW PHYSIOLOGY IS THAT IT IS PERMEATED BY AND BUT THEIR THEORIES WERE SO CONTRADICTORY BUT THEN HE HAD BEEN PRESSED TO COME TO THE GREAT HOUSE INSTEAD BUT THEN I SUPPOSE YOU DON T BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE TRAVELED BUT THEN TO BETRAY MY FATHER NO BUT THERE ARE OTHER HARMONIES AS FAR REACHING IN THIS CONNECTION THAT BECOME MANIFEST ONLY AFTER PATIENT OBSERVATION BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE BUT THERE I THINK ENDS THE RESEMBLANCE BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS GOING TO MAKE A STILL FURTHER JOURNEY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH RESEMBLANCE BUT THERE IS REAL BEAUTY AT LYME AND IN SHORT BUT THERE IS SOME HOPE BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE BUT THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO TUMULT THE DUKE OF YORK BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO ANNOUNCE THIS OPINION BUT THERE WAS ONE ELEPHANT A NEW ELEPHANT AN ELEPHANT S CHILD BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE BUT THERE WERE IN THE PALACE A FEW PERSONS WHO KNEW BETTER BUT THESE APPEAR TO TEND TO MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE BODIES WE CALL HEAVY SUCH AS STONES DOWNWARDS BUT THESE ARE ALL LANDSMEN OF WEEK DAYS PENT UP IN LATH AND PLASTER BUT THEY ARE LUCKY BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM BUT THEY ARE MERCIFULLY CONSERVING TO ARMS SENSITIVE TO SUNBURN BUT THEY ARE SELDOM IF EVER DISTINGUISHED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL PRECISELY ALIKE BUT THEY ARE SURE THE RIGHT GUY IS OUT THERE BUT THEY BREAK OUT SOMETIMES THERE S NO DENYING IT AND THEN WELL BUT THEY CAN T DEAL WITH IT BUT THEY CAN T IMAGINE THAT THIS WAS THE ARRANGEMENT BUT THEY DESERVED THEM HOW ZEALOUSLY THEY WAITED ON THE GUESTS BUT THEY DON T REALLY KNOW US BUT THEY HAVE FURNISHED NEW METHODS OF MEASURING THE RATE OF MOVEMENT OF PROJECTILES TO BUT THEY HAVEN T FOUND HER YET BUT THEY KNOW THAT YOU ARE RIGHT BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY BUT THEY MUST LONG FEEL THAT TO FLATTER AND FOLLOW OTHERS BUT THEY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SHOW OFF OR BECOME PERT BUT THEY NEVER MADE IT HOME BUT THEY SET OFF TO LOOK FOR THE ABORIGINAL FLORA AND PRESENTLY AFTER EVER SO MANY DAYS BUT THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN HE WOULD LOOK FOR HER BUT THEY THAT GAVE NOT THEIR VOTE ARE THEREFORE INNOCENT BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLY CANNOT REPRESENT ANY MAN IN THINGS UNWARRANTED BY THEIR LETTERS BUT THEY WANT TO CAPTURE ONLY A SMALL WINDOW BUT THEY WERE CONVINCED HE WAS HERE BUT THEY WERE SOON AGAIN DISTURBED AND WANDERED TO THE SHORES OF HUDSON S BAY BUT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE CEASED FIGHTING HAD THEY BEEN AWARE OF IT BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED BUT THIS DEEPENING AND BROADENING OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED NEXT TO NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFITS BUT THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE BUT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT THIS IS THE TRUTH BUT THIS IS VERY TRAGIC BUT THIS ISN T THE HIGH VELDT CAN T YOU SEE BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED BUT THIS VERY MORNING HE SO NEARLY CAUGHT ME THAT IT IS A WONDER THAT MY HAIR IS NOT SNOW WHITE FROM FRIGHT BUT THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO MEN ACCUSTOMED TO POLAR EXPEDITIONS BUT THOSE WHOSE MEMORIES GO BACK TO THE TINDER BOX PERIOD BUT THOU MEEK LOVER OF THE GOOD BUT THOUGH DISCOMFITED AND DISAPPOINTED BUT THOUGH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IMPROVEMENTS BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA BUT TO EQUAL HIS SUCCESS ONE MUST HAVE THE MIND WHICH HE INTENDED BUT TO HAVE NO FAMILY TO RECEIVE AND ESTIMATE HIM PROPERLY BUT TO PASS ON TO THEIR SUCCESSORS BUT TO SAY INSTEAD PLEASE DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HER BUT TO TAKE A LARGE HOE AND A SHOVEL ALSO BUT TO THE LIVING EYE IT WILL BE MANIFESTED SOONER OR LATER STEALING SLOWLY ON THE SENSES BUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING A MOLECULAR FABRIC WITHOUT DESTROYING IT BUT TOAD FOR IT WAS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SETTLED STERNLY TO HIS WORK BUT TOWN CLOTHES IN THE COUNTRY PROCLAIM YOUR IGNORANCE OF FITNESS BUT TWO OR THREE PIECES OF RED BUNTING BUT UGLIER YET IS THE HUMP WE GET FROM HAVING TOO LITTLE TO DO BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BUT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL BUT

WHAT KIND OF A YACHT WAS THIS IT MUST BE OF A CERTAIN SIZE TO HAVE GOT SO FAR BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT WHAT THINKS LAZARUS BUT WHAT WAS THERE FOR A FATHER TO DO BUT WHATEVER BY ENDS MAY MAR THEIR DIGNITY AND IMPEDE THEIR USEFULNESS BUT WHEN HE LAID ASIDE HIS HELMET AND IN HIS BUT WHEN HE WAS JUST NEAR ENOUGH FOR A GOOD AIM HE TOOK OUT HIS SLING AND HURLED A STONE AIMED AT THE GIANT S FOREHEAD BUT WHEN MEAT IS SCARCE WE ARE GLAD ENOUGH TO EAT IT BUT WHEN PAIN IS OVER THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT OFTEN BECOMES A PLEASURE BUT WHEN POSSIBLE A THICK ANKLE SHOULD HAVE A DARK STOCKING BUT WHEN THE PRODUCT OF SUCH SPECULATION IS PLACED ON A LEVEL WITH THOSE GENERALISATIONS OF MORPHOLOGICAL TRUTHS BUT WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE IS AN ASSEMBLY AND THE DEBT TO A STRANGER BUT WHERE IT GROWS AT ALL CLOSE THREE FOURTHS OR MORE BECOME NAKED BUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING REPEATEDLY SMELT THE SEA AS A MERCHANT SAILOR I SHOULD NOW TAKE IT INTO MY HEAD TO

WITHOUT AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE CARRIED ROUND TO HER BUT WORTHWHILE PEOPLE ARE INFLUENCED IN HER DISFAVOR BUT YES FROM THE LITTLE ANIMALS OF THE FIELDS AND WOODS BUT YET ALL TRULY STILL REVOLVING

AGAINST ANIMAL ETIQUETTE TO DWELL ON POSSIBLE TROUBLE AHEAD THAT IT IS SAID TO EXPRESS A PERIODIC LAW OF RECURRENT SIMILARITIES THAT IT MAY WELL BE CALLED THE YOSEMITE PINE THAT IT REQUIRES A STRONG MORAL PRINCIPLE TO PREVENT ME FROM DELIBERATELY STEPPING INTO THE STREET THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SO LONG AS A CERTAIN PURPLE LOCK THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK THROUGH THEM THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF METAPHYSICAL THAT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER AND IT WAS SOON OVER THAT KINETIC ENERGY APPEARS TO BE IMPARTED BY IMPACT IS A FACT OF DAILY AND HOURLY EXPERIENCE THAT LEST I

FLEXIBILITY THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME THAT MEANS A LOT THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT ALL BE TRUE THAT MIST WILL PRESENTLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO SNOW THAT MORNING THE CONTENDING FACTIONS IN HIS COUNCIL HAD DURING SOME DAYS THAT MOST DESOLATING BRAND OF CYNICISM WHICH IS PRODUCED BY DEFEAT THROUGH INSIGNIFICANCE THAT MUST BE GRANTED AT THE OUTSET BUT A WOMAN WHO HAS TALENT THAT MUST BE THE CONNECTION THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT THAT NO DEFINITE CONCLUSION COULD BE ARRIVED AT

AND WAS CARRIED SENSELESS TO HER CHAMBER THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY INFLUENCED BY APPEARANCES IN EACH THAT SHE WAS AT LAST ABOUT TO CROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR HIM THAT SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE ZONE THAT SINCE THE SEQUOIA FORESTS PRESENT A MORE AND MORE ANCIENT ASPECT AS THEY EXTEND SOUTHWARD THAT SOME OF THE RESULTS THUS OBTAINED THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE THAT SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED BY LAPLACE THAT SUMPTUARY LAWS WERE ENACTED TO CONTROL TOO GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE THAT TEASES THAT IS PETULANT AND DISOBEDIENT AND A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY THAT THE ATTAINMENT OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH HAS BEEN EFFECTED THAT THE BOARD HAS ACCEPTED MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE CELEBRATED TRAVELLER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A SERVANT NAMED MADGE THAT THE CONNOTATION OF THESE TERMS IN THE MIND OF THE MODERN IS ALMOST INFINITELY DIFFERENT THAT THE CROCODILE HAD PULLED IT OUT INTO A REALLY TRULY TRUNK THAT THE CURRENCY HAD TO BE CHANGED THAT THE EXTRA MOISTURE FOUND IN CONNECTION WITH THE DENSER GROWTHS IS AN EFFECT OF THEIR PRESENCE INSTEAD OF A CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENCE THAT THE FIDGIT TOLD US THIRTEEN MONTHS IN AN AQUARIUM I WAS BORN IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN THAT THE GROUND WILL BECOME ROUGH AND UNEVEN THAT THE HISTORY OF ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE PROVES THAT THEY MUST ATTAIN A CONSIDERABLE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT OLD TENAYA WAS TAKEN ALONG AS GUIDE THAT THE KEENEST SIGHT COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE SNOW THAT THE LOWER REGION IS THE PLACE TO WHICH HEAVY THINGS TEND THEIR PROPER PLACE IN SHORT

NOT TOO HOT OR TOO COLD BUT OH THE DULLNESS OF THAT LIFE THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS A CULMINATING IRONY AS INDEED WAS THE SAVOURY IN ITS WAY THAT THE WORLD I FOUND SO INDISPENSABLE COULD AFTER ALL DISPENSE WITH ME THAT THEIR LABORS WERE DIRECTED TO PRACTICAL ENDS THAT THERE AIN T NO RELATIONS AND THE TOWN S GOT TO BE RESPONSIBLE THAT THERE IS STILL AN APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM THE FOLIAGE OF THE SAPLINGS IS DARK BLUISH GREEN IN COLOR THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A SUDDEN CHANGE HALF AN HOUR HENCE THAT THEY CAN EVEN CUT OUT A BIT OF ONE OF THEIR EARS WITH THE STIFF THONG AT THE END OF THE WHIP THAT THEY COULD ASSURE THEM ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BOTH TURNED BY HIM THAT THEY MIGHT DECIDE WHERE TO MAKE THEIR HOME FOR THE SUMMER THAT THEY SHED OFF RAIN AND SNOW LIKE A ROOF MAKING FINE MANSIONS FOR STORM BOUND BIRDS AND MOUNTAINEERS THAT THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE APPROACH OF THE HUNTERS THAT THOUGH ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS HE WAS INDISCREETLY AND UNSEASONABLY EAGER THAT TOO IS IN THE DEEP HOLE WHEN THE BARREL SANK THE CURRENTS DRIFTED IT NORTHWARDS THAT VERY NEXT MORNING WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF THE EQUINOXES THAT VIBRATIONS OF MOLECULES CAUSING AND CAUSED BY VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER CONSTITUTE HEAT IS DISCUSSED THAT WAS A MONEY DROP THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL THAT WAS EXACTLY THE WORD THAT SHE WAS GOING TO USE THAT WAS HIS BEST SUBJECT THAT WAS NEVER HER INTENTION THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THAT WAS NOT VERY EASY THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL THAT WAS PREDICTABLE THAT WAS SAL PERRY ON THE MODERATION ROAD AND RAN AWAY AND LEFT HER THAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF ALL THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED US FROM CHOKING I WANTED TO WHISPER TO CLIPPA TO BE BRAVE AND STICK IT OUT THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FEET HIGH AND OVER EIGHTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS THAT WAY THEY CAN GO ANYWHERE AND AREN T SPECIFIC TO A DECOR THEME TIME OF YEAR ETC THAT WE HAD THE PROPER FOOD TO EAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND THAT WE MUST LOOK FOR LIGHT AND GUIDANCE THAT WE OUGHT TO EXHAUST KNOWN CAUSES BEFORE SEEKING FOR THE EXPLANATION THAT WERE FIRST LAID BARE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD THAT WHAT I M GOING TO SUGGEST WON T SUIT YOU FOR I KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR PLANS THAT WHATSOEVER DEBT IS BY THAT ASSEMBLY CONTRACTED OR WHATSOEVER UNLAWFUL ACT IS DECREED THAT WHERE THE GREEKS DID WONDERS WAS IN JUST THOSE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE THAT WHICH IS TRUE OF ITS ADOLESCENCE IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES THAT WHICH STIRS THEIR PULSES IS THE LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE ANCIENT IDEA OF THE INHERENT TENDENCY TO MOTION OF BODIES THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH THAT WILL GIVE ME ALL I WISH THAT WINTER IS THE TIME TO VISIT THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS THAT WON T BE NECESSARY THAT WORD IS RECOGNIZED THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER THAT WOULD BE HER THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY EMBARRASSING THAT WOULD INDEED BE AN IMPORTANT RESULT OF THE ENTERPRISE THAT WOULDN T DO BECAUSE IT S MEAN TO AUNT MIRANDA AND ANYWAY IT ISN T GOOD THAT YOU COULD HEAR ALL UP AND DOWN THE LIMPOPO THAT YOU HAVE EXPENDED ON
