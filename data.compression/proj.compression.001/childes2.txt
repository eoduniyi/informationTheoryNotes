A STATUE YOU RE RIGHT HE HANDLED EACH MASTERPIECE WITH AS MUCH CARE AND RESPECT AS IF HE HAD PAINTED IT HIMSELF HE WOULD ALSO TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN POINTING OUT THE ARTISTIC FEATURES OF CERTAIN PIECES OF GREEK SCULPTURE WHICH RESTED IN THE DARK CORNERS OF THE STORAGE ROOM SHE IS WEARING QUITE A SNAZZY DRESS I THINK AS OH WE MISSED A PAGE NORMAN S ONLY WORRY WAS KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SHARP EYED UPSTAIRS GUARD WHO OFTEN CAME TO THE BASEMENT TO SET TRAPS FOR MICE I KNOW THEY RE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE GUARD AS FOR NORMAN HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND HIDE INSIDE AN OLD ARMORED KNIGHTS HELMET UP THERE HE FELT PERFECTLY SAFE ACTUALLY THE HELMET WAS NORMAN S HOME WHICH HE HAD MADE INTO A VERY COMFORTABLE AND WORKABLE STUDIO JUST SEE WHAT A SPLENDID SKY LIGHT THE VISOR MADE LIKE MOST EVERYBODY NORMAN HAD A HOBBY EACH NIGHT AFTER WORK HE TRIED TO CREATE SOMETHING PLEASING OR BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS A PAINTING OF SWISS CHEESE AND CRACKERS OR A STATUE ONE BITTER COLD DAY NORMAN DECIDED TO STAY IN HIS STUDIO AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF WIRE I KNOW HE S MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF WIRE IT S A MOUSE TRAP AND HE S TAKING THE WIRE OFF OF IT TO MAKE A SCULPTURE RIGHT HE MADE A TRAPEZE THAT S RIGHT ALL THROUGH THE DAY AND FAR INTO THE NIGHT NORMAN TWISTED AND BENT WIRES INTO MANY STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS SHAPES UNTIL AT LAST HE CREATED SOMETHING HE WAS REALLY PROUD OF IT LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUSE ON A TRAPEZE OH YES THAT NIGHT WHEN HE FINALLY WENT TO SLEEP HE WAS A TIRED BUT HAPPY MOUSE EARLY NEXT MORNING WHEN NORMAN WENT OUTSIDE TO SHOVEL AWAY SNOW IN FRONT OF HIS DOORWAY HE
