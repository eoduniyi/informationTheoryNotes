We now put content in the definition of entropy by establishing the fundamental limit for the compression of information. Data compression can beachieved by assigning short descriptions to the most frequent outcomesof the data source, and necessarily longer descriptions to the less frequentoutcomes. For example, in Morse code, the most frequent symbolis represented by a single dot. In this chapter we find the shortest averagedescription length of a random variable.
