THE USUAL CONVERSATION WITH JUDY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY APPARENTLY I FORGET WHY SHE AND MIKE STAYED UP TIL ONE THIRTY OR TWO LAST NIGHT DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND WHAT THEIR PRIORITYS WAS AND WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF THEIR LIVES AND WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE THEY WAS AND GOT TO ME THAT S PRETTY HEAVY CHUCKLES I SAID IF YOU HAVE TO REALLY START REALLY CONSIDERING IT IT S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DECISION YOU KNOW YOU LOOKED CHEERY AND HEALTHY THIS MORNING LAUGHS YOU THINK THAT WOULD MAKE ME LOOK SICK AND ILL WELL PROBABLY UHHUH AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE DO I HOPE FOR THEM YEAH LAUGHS I SAID SH I WISH I HAD HAD MY HEART HAD NOT BEEN SO HEAVY WITH JULIET I WOULD VE ENJOYED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH HER HER ATTITUDE TOWARD FAMILY PLANING AND POPULATION CONTROL DO YOU THINK SHE HAS A STRONG WELL IT S FUNNY THAT FOR FOR A PERSON WHO MAKES A POINT OF DEDICATING HERSELF TO THE SOLUTION OF HUMAN PROBLEMS ETCETERA IS TO SOME DEGREE THAT S TRUE AN IDEALIST TO SAY YOU SHOULD BE UNRESTRAINED IN YOUR IN THE REPRODUCTION OF YOUR SPECIES BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY IT S FUN WHICH WAS WHAT HER DEFENSE WAS HAVING KIDS IS A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION TO THE PARENTS NOT NECESSARILY THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR THE KIDS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT THAT THEY WAS A COMFORT IN THEIR OLD AGE AND SO FORTH WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO ME WAS HAVING KIDS HAVING MORE THAN ONE MORE THAN TWO EVEN IS OKAY IF YOU RE IF YOU RE THE RICH AND PRIVILEGED CLASS ESSENTIALLY BUT THAT S TERRIBLY ELITIST BECAUSE HOW LONG DOES SHE EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS IN WHICH THEY PRESENTLY FIND THEMSELVES LET S SAY YA KNOW A GENERATION DOWN THE ROAD MAY BE TWO OR THREE I MEAN YA KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR ADAMS FAMILYS AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU LOOK AT YA KNOW THERE WAS A THING IN TIME MAGAZINE THIS WEEK ON DESCENDANTS OF THE OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING FATHERS AND THEY RE PLUMBERS AN AND WHATEVER YA KNOW MHM MHM AND THERE S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT WH WHEN YOU RE TALKING ABOUT A PROBLEM THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE NOT REALLY GONNA BE WELL THEY WILL BE FELT IMMEDIATELY BUT I THINK SHE BUT IF YOU RE TALKING ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT IS GOING TO BECOME CRITICAL IN SAY ONE MORE GENERATION OR TWO MORE GENERATIONS MHM BY WHICH TIME YOU HAVE NO REASON TO EXPECT THAT YOUR PROGENY ARE GONNA HAVE THE SAME VALUES WELL OR TH E OR THE SAME RESOURCES THAT YOU RE GONNA HAVE TO BRING UP THEIR CHILDREN AS BUT WHAT SHE ASSUMES IS THAT YOUR PROGENY NONDEPENDENTS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN S BRIGHTNESS OKAY THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS FALSE EVEN IF THEY ARE BRIGHTER IT DOESN T MEAN THAT THEY RE GONNA BE ECONOMICALLY SELF SUSTAINING AND EVEN IF THEY ARE ECONOMICALLY SELF SUSTAINING THEY RE GONNA TAKE UP SPACE AND THEY RE GONNA COMPETE FOR RESOURCES WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THEY RE GONNA BUY YA KNOW WHAT WAS BEFORE THE FAMILY THE FAMILY ACREAGE ON NANTUCKET WAS GONNA SPLIT BETWEEN THE THREE THAT S OKAY SWEETIE MALE HEIRS OR HOWEVER THEY DECIDE TO SPLIT IT I I AGREE BUT YOUR SPEAKING FROM THE CONSERVATIONIST S POINT OF VIEW AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR WELL EVEN EVEN FROM A HUMAN FROM AN AESTHETIC POINT OF VIEW IN WHICH SHE WANT I THINK THERE S SOME SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE IN THE BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DOES SHE WANT THAT I DON T KNOW WHETHER SHE IT SEEMS TO ME SHE S TAKING VERY MUCH IN THE ATTITUDE OF I FIND PLEASURE IN IT RIGHT NOW AND IT S SOMEBODY ELSE S PROBLEM LATER YOU THINK THAT S THE WAY SHE S VIEWING IT I THINK SHE S CAUGHT IN A FUNNY POSITION IN THAT SHE S NOW VERY MUCH OF A A WOMEN S MOVEMENT MEMBER BUT WHERE SHE SPENT HER LIFE BRINGING UP HER CHILDREN AND DOING NOTHING BUT BRINGING UP HER CHILDREN UHHUH UNTIL THEY WAS HIGH SCHOOL AGE MHM YOU CAN T REALLY SAY THAT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME MHM FIRST OF ALL SHE DOESN T BELIEVE IT YEAH SECONDLY SHE DOESN T WANNA BELIEVE IT YEAH SEE WHAT I M AIMING AT IS THAT ARGUMENTS FOR POPULATION CONTROL DON T SAY THAT THAT BRINGING UP CHILDREN IS A WASTE BY ANY MEANS MHM HUH YEAH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE FACT THAT CHILDREN ARE YA KNOW A RARE AND UNIQUE PLEASURE AND SO IT S JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER RARE AND UNIQUE PLEASURES LIKE DRIVING A TWELVE CYLINDER CAR AT EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR AT TIMES YOU JUST CAN T DO IT IN A WORLD OF FINITE RESOURCES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YA I CAN UNDERSTAND TWO BUT MORE THAN TWO NO MATTER HOW TALENTED AND CLEVER YOU MAY THINK YOU ARE IF YOU RE TALENTED AND CLEVER ENOUGH TO FEEL THOSE PEOPLE WHO AREN T WILL HAVE TOO MANY CHILDREN THEN YOU HAVE TO MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR YOUR SHARE TOO MANY WELL THAT S ANOTHER THING IT JUST GETS A LITTLE FUNNY BECAUSE FIRST IT S DISTINCTLY YA KNOW PEOPLE SAY THAT HEY HEY HEY HEY UHHUH HEY YOU THAT S NO GOOD IF YOU DON T WANNA EAT IT THAT S OKAY TOO BUT I DON T WANT YOU PLAYING WITH IT NO GOOD TO PLAY YA KNOW WHAT S A GOOD THING TO EAT WITH UM YOUR SPOON SPOON IS VERY GOOD FOR CAKE SPOON IS MUCH BETTER FOR CAKE FOR YOU WHAT SHE EXPRESSES A LOT OF CONCERN FOR AND SEEMS TO HAVE A GENUINE CONCERN FOR IS REFLECTED IN THE PROGRAMS IN THE AND SO FORTH YA KNOW THE THE DISENFRANCHISED THE DISADVANTAGED THE POOR THE NEEDY AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND THEN SHE TURNS AROUND AND SAYS THAT YOU AS MEMBERS OF THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS SHOULDN T RESTRAIN FROM HAVING CHILDREN BECAUSE YOURS ARE GONNA BE YOURS ARE GONNA BE BUT THEY SHOULD BECAUSE R S ARE YEAH I MEAN THAT S THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION IT IS IT S TRUE WHICH WHICH STRIKES ME AS YA KNOW ELITIST IN THE EXTREME WELL IT IS YOU RE QUITE RIGHT IT MAKES HER SO OBVIOUSLY CONTENTED THAT UHHUH MAY EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAS SO MUCH TROUBLE GETTING ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE SHE HAS TO DEAL WITH I HATE TO SAY THAT I GO BOTH WAYS NOT SO MUCH ON THE ISSUE OF OF UM HAVING MORE THAN TWO BUT WHEN I TALK TO HER I M SHE OR SOMEBODY LIKE HER AND THEY SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE WHAT FUN IT IS I FIND MYSELF SAYING RIGHT THAT S GREAT FIRST I HAVE TO CLEAN YOU OFF WOULD YOU WAIT HERE HEY WHAT S UP YOU DON T WANT ANY I THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH ON YOUR SHIRT TO LAST YOU THROUGH A LONG COLD WINTER LET S SEE YOUR FACE HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WEREN T HOLDING ON TO THIS CHAIR AND YOU WERE CLIMBING UP ON IT LIKE THAT YOU D FALL ON YOUR NOSE HEY GET DOWN

THAT S BEYOND OUR BORDERS YOU MUST NEVER GO THERE SIMBA BUT I THOUGHT A KING CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS THERE S MORE TO BEING KING THAN GETTING YOUR WAY ALL THE TIME EVERYTHING YOU SEE EXISTS TOGETHER IN A DELICATE BALANCE AS KING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BALANCE AND RESPECT ALL THE CREATURES FROM THE CRAWLING ANT TO THE LEAPING ANTELOPE WE RE ALL CONNECTED IN THE GREAT CIRCLE OF LIFE LATER AS

DURING THE ICE AGE OF THE PLEISTOCENE EPOCH RIGHT WHAT WAS THE ONE THAT WE SAW AT THE PEQUOT MUSEUM REMEMBER WE SAW ONE OH THE MASTODON RIGHT LOOKS SIMILAR RIGHT DURING THE ICE AGE MASSIVE ICE SHEETS CALLED GLACIERS COVERED VAST AREAS OF LAND BECAUSE IT HAD A THICK LAYER OF FAT UNDER ITS SKIN AS WELL AS ABUNDANT HAIR THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH MANAGED TO KEEP WARM IN THE YEAR ROUND WINTER CRASH YEAH I THINK SO THE MAMMOTH LOST RELATIVELY LITTLE BODY HEAT THROUGH IT S EARS BOOM IT S EARS WERE VERY SMALL IT S LONG CURVED TUSKS ENABLED IT TO FIND FOOD BY CLEARING AWAY SNOW AND ICE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS HAVE BEEN FOUND PRESERVED IN THE FROZEN TUNDRA OF SIBERIA PREHISTORIC MAN WHO PROBABLY HUNTED THEM FOR FOOD DECORATED CAVES WITH DRAWINGS OF THESE MAGNIFICENT ANIMALS VERY LONG HUH WHO S THIS THE SABER TOOTH TIGERS FIRST APPEARED SOMETIME BETWEEN TWENTY SIX AND THIRTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO OH MY GOSH HIS TUSKS ARE GOING IN HIS MOUTH WOW THERE WE GO THE SCIENTIFIC NAME FOR THE SABER TOOTH TIGER IS MAKERI MACHAIRODONT MACHAIRODONT MACHAIRODONT DOES THAT SOUND BETTER YOU THINK MACHAIRODONT THIS GROUP INCLUDED MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CATS ALL OF WHICH HAD LONG FANGS IN THEIR UPPER JAWS THESE CATS WERE CARNIVORES OR MEAT EATERS AND USE THEIR SHARP SHARP TEETH TO PIERCE THE THICK SKINS OF THE PLANT EATING ANIMALS ONE OF THE BEST KNOW SABER TOOTH TIGERS IS THE SMILADON WHICH MEANS KNIFE TOOTH IN LATIN EXACT YEAH SMILADON SOUNDS LIKE MASTODON THEY RE BOTH LATIN NAMES HELLO SMARTY PANTS THE MACHRAUCHENIA WOW MACHRAUCHENIA MEANS LARGE THROAT MACHRAUCHENIA WAS A PLANT EATER OR AN HERBIVORE THAT ACHOO ACHOO THE MACHRAUCHENIA WAS ABOUT ELEVEN FEET TALL AND WAS SHAPED LIKE A CAMEL BUT WITH NO HUMPS FOSSILS SHOW THAT ITS NOSE OPENINGS WERE HIGH UP ON THE SKULL SUGGESTING THAT IT HAD SOME SORT OF

PREDATORS HUH WHAT S THIS THAT IS THE BRONTOTHERIUM IT SOUNDS LIKE A BRONTOSAURUS RIGHT WHAT ANIMAL DOES THE BRONTOTHERIUM LOOK LIKE KINDUV KIND OF LIKE A HIPPO KINDUV KIND OF LIKE A RHINOCEROS YEAH I

ABOUT FIVE FEET TALL AND HAD A LONG NECK AND SMALL WINGS BECAUSE THE WINGS WERE SO SMALL THEY COULD NOT USE THEM TO FLY INSTEAD THE WINGS MAY HAVE HELPED THE BIRD TO MAINTAIN BALANCE WHILE IT RAN ON ITS POWERFUL LEGS YUMMY HUH THE GIANT SLOTH HAD LONG CURVED CLAWS AND FED BY STRIPPING LEAVES WITH ITS TONGUE BUT WHEN THE GIANT SLOTH WAS ON THE GROUND ITS CLAWS FORCED THE ANIMAL TO WALK ON THE
